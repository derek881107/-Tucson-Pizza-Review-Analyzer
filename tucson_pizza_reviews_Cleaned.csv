2-Y4QSgJXEYFJTJIo71IPQ,IPcgVWB-KXlb5bqt8fqE0Q,KDC4yE8av8-A5TxgmjjUiw,3,1,1,1,Me and the family came in on a Thursday for a few games of bowling. When we showed up the place was packed with what looked to be league players (all have own balls and equipment with them). We asked if there was any open lanes we could use for a few hours. We where told there was one lane open at the very end and we could use that one. We got all set up and started to play. The bowling equipment is pretty good to be honest. It's not super modern but not super old either. They have plenty of balls to use and they make it easy for the kids with the bumpers on their turns only. I have to say they need new shoes though. These things have been used since the late 90s or early 2000's for sure. We also got some food which to be honest was pretty tasty. The few complaints I had is an error code came up that said we had to wait for a tech. It took about 15 min for him to show up. He clicked things on the screen and walked away with the code still there. So I called the desk and he said he was working on it. He could have told us that he was so we didnt think he was just leaving us. Then we wanted to play another game and the guy up front told us we had to leave due to league. He could have told us that when we showed up. If we knew we only had an hour we probably would have gone someplace else. Tucson is losing almost all their bowling centers which is bad for the average customer. The lack of centers means more league playing there and pushing out families. That also means they dont have to provide great service cause your options are limited. All in all it was a decent experience. Just with a few tweaks it could have been great.,3/13/2020 1:43,1
bFz6i8UdmIwgyTU0et2EjQ,Nay3mMq0PpjX1-WXx_IdpQ,7-cD0S7vJlUOuTpF2vQLOQ,1,0,0,0,They have the worst customer service skills imaginable. Do not go there if you want a quick pizza and don't call in because they won't even keep your order. I waited for over 30 minutes after I called in an order and they told me it wasn't ready yet then it wasn't in the system. Please save your time and money go to a different one becase the people who work here don't deserve it.,1/30/2020 4:44,0

She rolled her eyes and sighed when I requested napkins and silverware. The manager was also rude almost refusing to put up the guards for an 11 year old because it's only for ""under 10"". He was condescending and rude as well. When talking to him about the experience and how it was ruined but the terrible customer service he responded insincerely and sarcastically. I have been to many bowling alleys in Tucson and this is my first time ever having an experience this bad. The place was great but won't be returning due to the staff.",9/24/2020 2:38,0

But came to Posto Sano around 11AM and it was truly pleasant. Food came out on a timely manner and service was good. Food was tasteful and right amount of portions - would have given a 5 star but ordered dessert and they had ran out of cream for the fruit bowl and couldn't substitute it with anything else. Would recommend to anyone. Overall good place. Good job Danny Scordatos.,06-03-2020 14:29,1

Located on Campbell & Skyline, it's a very long drive from Sahuarita, but I was checking it out for a Meetup group - they don't take reservations for the nice patio (w/a fireplace) nor for inside seating. The staff is polite & helpful & I needed help to order from the touchscreen. their food is keto, vegetarian & vegan friendly which is quite trendy these days. They offer a variety of beverages to include, beer, wine & cocktails. Regular water & sparkling water is self-serve & no charge. They have an interesting, but limited menu consisting of salads, protein plates, vegeatarian plates, Roman pizza & panino. a 10% discount is given when ordering 2 vegetable plates w/a protein or for 3 vegetable plates. The dessert menu only had 3 items. The seared brazino was tasty, but a rather small portion for $11.95. The roasted brussel sprouts had good flavor, but were not tender & 2 X I sent back the risotto - $4.75- 'cause it was tepid @best. To appease me they brought me delicious asparagus. If It was closer to home I'd probably go back, but.....

My brother and I always talk about this special memory with my father and how good the food was. The other memory I have with this place is when me and my fiancé first started dating we took a trip to Tucson to do some hiking and sightseeing and had a great time and enjoyed everything Tucson had to offer especially this place. We love the lights in the gardens and the food was great. I would never called this place the best Italian food I've ever had but it was excellent because the food was savory and the ambience is relaxing and the customer service was superb. My fiancé left her purse there after hours and they were kind enough to open up well over two hours after we left the restaurant just so she can get her purse and everything was perfect. I would highly recommend this place plus it's close to college so the area is pretty cool. Don't expect to have the greatest Italian food ever but expect a great experience with some savory food items.,03-12-2020 19:06,1

Service:   Slow

Dinner: I ordered old fashioned spaghetti and meat balls..hard to mess up. The Caruso sauce was literally watery, the meatballs were so-so at best, and the garlic bread was bland.  How can garlic bread be bland???  The homemade sausage wasn't half bad, I'll give them that. And the manicotti was very good. 

Desert: The tiramisu didn't even have any coffee liquor (or if it did u could tell), and the Cannoli had a great big gaping hole in it; they didn't even bother to completely fill it.

Not a complicated order, was made online; estimated time was 40 minutes. As we approached the two hour mark I tried calling the store. Sat waiting for 15 minutes waiting for someone to pick up before I gave up. Tried calling again five minutes later, same thing. My son tried and got the same thing. No one was answering at the store.

At two hours and twenty five minutes a delivery driver shows up with the food. I am not mean, I do not yell and I do not curse. I simply ask him why it took so long to get the food to us. He gives a sad excuse that really does not answer my question and says I need to call the store. I told him I would but no one is answering the phones at the store. He says something about this is why he isn't a manager anymore and beats a hasty retreat before I can ask or say anything else.

The food was cold. Nothing is sadder than a pizza that has sat closed in a box and allowed to cool off except for chicken wings that have sat wrapped in foil in a box and allow to cool off.

The pizza just sucked, the sauce was light on top of the fact that it was cold and the cheese was skimped on as well.

The wings were inedible. When you get chicken wings and they are fried or baked you expect them to be crispy. That is part of the experience of the wing that makes them so good.

The skin on these wings was like limp rubbery flesh. It was disgusting and there was no saving them at that point since the sauce was on them.

All and all the experience left a bad taste in our mouths. While I understand that places are slammed with the pandemic this is the time for them to shine, not slack. You either put out your best work or you go down in flames.

My business will go with someone else who can deliver a quality tasty (and edible) product next time.",05-02-2020 06:07,0

After my first bite, I no longer cared because we were going to eat the whole (very big portion) of salad! It was so tasty. Even the chicken that didn't appear to be anything special was incredibly flavorful. You could tell the croutons were made in house too. The sauce on the wings were also super good! My only issue with the wings was they gave us a lot of very very tiny wings. Our order of 8 turned into 10 because I think they were trying to make up for the tiny ones but I would've preferred to be shorted then eat the weird meat from the tiny ones. The normal sized wings were so good though! 

The pizza however, was very disappointing. I wanted to like it since I really liked the salad and wings, but as someone who really enjoys pizza, this one did not hit the mark. The sauce was bland and sweet, which made the whole pizza have very little flavor. Not even the toppings could save it.

#ThankYouThursday 4-14-2020 
Scott V. & team Fiamme , 
I'd like to thank you & your team for continuing to crank out tasty pies & more during these challenging times. Your authentic pizza brings back memories of a summer spent with family in region near potsuale. Not making it to the greeting card store for Mother's Day I created a card for family member who was also in Naples out of your fun pizza box with map of Italy & pizza pie being served in an iconic Pulcinella mask. It was well received . I wish I could give another award or metal to hang in your front foyer. Thanks again for giving us authentic comfort food in somewhat uncomfortable times! Respecto, John k

It's not the fanciest place yes. But man is their pizza just fantastic.  I can't make up my mind if it's the dough that is so perfect, or the the great toppings that they have. Nevertheless, I've tried a different pizza every time I have been and haven't been disappointed.

About the garlic bread. Nothing inspires more confidence than watching someone stuff leaf after leaf of basil into a blender. It did not disappoint. The pesto was NOT a thin green smear, but a bold thick layer between a base of garlic bread, and a thick blanket of cheese. Delicious. (Only ate half, the rest is for dinner.)

The pizza was quite flavorful, but what took it to a higher tier was the unused marinara sauce. I added it to the pizza with a knife. It really did it for me.

We are planning a family dinner in the future so we can add some pasta.

I also had the chicken meatballs ($5.95) there were 4 perfectly seasoned meatballs in a fresh tomato sauce. Garlic toast which for only $1.50 for 4 good size squares that were perfectly toasted and crunchy. I ended the meal with the olive oil cake ($4.95).

I have been coming here for the last few years not including last year because of covid, for Homecoming Weekend each year. The first year, it was pretty fun and busy, lots of people, everyone enjoying themselves. Now not so much, I would assume for some of the reasons that are reviewed on this page, including my experience this past weekend. 

The bartender that interacted with me was very unpleasant/rude.
She had dark hair with glasses and it was saturday night (11/06/21)
The bartender very rudely asked what do you want to order, I took a breath to start talking and she immediately asks for a second time in a RUDER tone ""what do you want to order?"" I think a lot of customers (probably college students) cow down to her, etc. and it gives her some false idea that it is okay to talk like that to anyone & everyone and no one will say anything. 
It was 8:30ish so still pretty early and the place was not that busy. Almost no one at the bar when I was ordering. She had the time for me to take a breath, relax.

I answered her with the same tone she gave me, ""I'm trying to tell you"". I don't know what customer takes that but I certainly do not. Lady, you are a bartender in a college town, not a senior executive at a Fortune 500, calm down.

Also, they checked my group of friends' id's at the door. Then proceeded to need ID's for a pitcher of beer. Which whatever....BUT THEN a separate bartender from my experience told my friend he needed a 2nd ID for a pitcher. You just checked our ID's at the door! Like I said before, I think the staff are jerks to give them this ""power trip"".

Garlic bread was complimentary! I'm not much of a bread person but really enjoyed the garlic bread and the crispy outside. Really good dipped in the soup!

There is another popular restaurant across the street and people park in front of this place and they shouldn't. I guess it's not Fresco's fault. I'll keep going.,2/15/2020 14:24,1

Unfortunately, I felt like I had to say something about this restaurant. I remember coming here as a kid and loving the place so I decided to bring my girlfriend for our 3 year anniversary. What a huge disappointment. So much so that I felt the need to make it up to her the following night with a proper dinner. I had the Caruso special which comes with spaghetti, raviolis, meatballs and your choice of sauce. When it came out there was so much meat sauce on it that you couldn't see the spaghetti or the raviolis. Not the mention the sauce was so watery that barley moving my plate closer made it overflow on to the table. The meatballs, which I was excited about had no flavor and tasted almost as if they were frozen. It was a huge portion which I suppose is good for people that like that but I'm just a normal guy who likes to be able to finish a dish not take half of it home. Now my girlfriend had the seafood pasta delight. This thing was a mix of clams, shrimp, mussels I believe and maybe one other with white sauce and noodles. It came out and looked like it was just thrown on the plate and sent out. Not appetizing at all. Plus she said that the shrimp tasted over cooked. I will say this the only thing good about this place is the price point but even that is a little iffy considering the food wasn't as good as we had hoped. Oh I almost forgot, you would think the simplest thing for a Italian restaurant would be garlic bread. Well not here, it was dry like it had been sitting and not very flavorful at all. Service was decent but not great as well.",10/30/2020 22:59,0

As we were hungrier than normal, we ordered prosciutto and mozzarella.  Disappointed with the presentation as we were expecting the classic prosciutto and mozzarella.  The one here is doused with the classic San Marzano sauce.  The sauce was awesome but I'm not used to eating prosciutto in this manner.  One thing that has fallen off is the service here.  The pizzaoili were not the problem.  It's been the service staff.  It hasn't been that bad, the changes the last couple of months are noticeable.

The salad was decent and came with a red wine vinegrette and green dressing (both were good).  The salad also had some kind of crunchy bits that gave it some texture and had feta cheese sprinkled around which tasted good.  The garlic bread was a little burnt but i think its because of the oven they use, bread was decent and crunchy but soft at the same time, with a little garlic taste.  I wasn't happy that i was forced to pay a tip.  Why am I paying a tip???  One star for the small shrimp, and minus another for forcing a tip.  I wasn't served anything so I shouldn't be forced to pay that.  Food was ok, not horrible, but not worth $24 either.  Should've been priced at $12-$14 in my opinion.

Scott V. & team Fiamme , 
I'd like to thank you & your team for continuing to crank out tasty pies & more, food during these challenging times. Your authentic pizza brings back memories of a summer spent with family near Naples in region near Pozzouli. 
Not making it to the greeting card store for Mother's Day I created a card for family member who was also in Naples out of your fun pizza box with map of Italy & pizza pie being served in an iconic Pulcinella mask. It was well received . 
I wish I could give another award or metal to hang in your front foyer. Well deserved! 
Thanks again for giving us authentic comfort food in somewhat uncomfortable times! 
Respecto, John k

Lol they last time I ordered my calzone from here it tasted weird. We called and come to find out they changes the ricotta vendor. Hmm not a good move it tasted like the ricotta went south of the boarder. When she check the dates for us on that cheese she said everything was upto date so. I woke up the next day with belly pain.

So I like to follow a vegan diet and initially based on the website I was under the impression there were only a few vegan items as the ""vegan"" tag was only next to specific things. However the girl at the counter informed me that there are also two pizzas that can be made vegan - the tomato and basil one, and the mushroom one (I think this should be made more clear on the site and paper menu... there's the word ""veggie"" next to it but one would assume that just means vegetarian and doesn't imply it can be made vegan). Holy hell - this was one of the best meals I've had in a long time (and it came out lightening fast by the way). I got the veganized form of the funghi pizza and it was probably one of the best if not the best vegan item at a restaurant I've ever eaten. The creaminess of the vegan cheese, the earthiness of the mushrooms and the crispy, chewy crust was to die for. I also got a side of the vegan kale slaw. WTF - it was SO FREAKING GOOD!

The pizza was a hefty portion! It was indeed like a hybrid of Neapolitan and Brooklyn style pizza. The slices were large and the crust thin like a Brooklyn style pizza, but was a bit more pliable with more of a tender chew to it like a Neapolitan pizza. The pizza was so good that the toddler picked up a slice (The largest one of course) and licked it to claim it as hers. She is learning early on in life about pizza property rights!

I appreciated that the fresh basil was in a bunch off to the side of the pizza so you can add it right when you eat it. Some of the basil was a bit tired, brown and wilted looking though but overall it still tasted good.

The saddest part is that I really liked this place and would come here all the time. Now the thought of giving this place my money makes me disgusted. They don't deserve my money. Who is in charge here? From a business standpoint, it's usually not a very smart idea to turn regular customers away and be so rude to them that they actively hope you go out of business. 

This guy is such an idiot. Great job dude your so smart. Yeah you win. You got me. You do realize that your only hurting the business you represent by keeping people from giving it money. Genius idea. I'm sure after his job as a bouncer here, he will go on to be the next Steve Jobs.

Someone please fire this fool and replace him with competent people who understand the basics of how a business works. In the service industry you actually want to be nice to your regular paying customers. I guess to some people that's just too hard to understand.",9/17/2021 7:45,0

For dinner, we had the Caesar salad with grilled chicken and the funghi flatbread - perfect portions for sharing. The chicken was flavorful and not dry at all and was packed separately from the salad and dressing so nothing got soggy. The flatbread was delicious - topped with lots of mushrooms, an amazing truffle aioli sauce, and cheesy goodness. The dough was chewy on the inside with the right amount of crunch on the outside.

They use a great oven, the crust comes out crispy, bubbly, and chewy all at the same time; the sauce the cheese ratio is perfect.  Hint of sweetness in the tomato sauce, and fresh basil will top it at the end when it comes out of the oven.  Like the native New Yorker I am, I don't fuss with a lot of additional ingredients.  I like to keep it simple and traditional when it comes to my pizza.

And this pizza is SIMPLY delicious!  You can really taste the dough, too.  It's not just there to support the cheese and sauce and provide crunch.  It's also there to provide an additional layer of flavor.  

On top of that, and I don't know if they're still doing this these days, but they usually have great deals on Mondays.  What a value!  To get THIS quality pizza for such a low price.

It has been a staple of Tucson for like 100+ years and is a 4th generation restaurant.  It is absolutely THE BEST Italian restaurant in the state of Arizona - if not the entire United States.  They make ALL their sauces and pastas by hand.  Trust me, I have seen their freezers and they are authentically handmade from recipes developed by Sal's grandfather.  They even use some of the same POTS AND PANS!  LOL 

The COVID pandemic has been so hard on all the restaurants in Tucson.  Our city would not be the same without Caruso's so we have purchased several LARGE gift certificates.  We occasionally order food to go, but we are content to leave the funds there just to help them during this tough time.

Caruso's is especially wonderful for birthday celebrations and meeting friends.  This seems a lifetime ago, but I organized a large event of about 30 people for the All Souls Procession.  Now keep in mind that this is always one of their BUSIEST days.  I booked months in advance and had it set up.  We were given a large separate room and the staff was FLAWLESS with the orders.  As ALWAYS, the food was EXQUISITE!  They have an amazing wine list too!  I am sure that we were a little noisy because everyone was having such a great time and we were all in costume and makeup.

If you've ever dined at Vivace or Scordato's Pizza(before he sold it), you'll recognize some of the menu items and certainly the flavors. Due to COVID, they currently only have outdoor seating and pick up available. Pre-COVID the ordering system was all digital via touchscreens. I placed my order online and it was ready right on time. You can also request curbside pick-up if you prefer. I forgot, so I went inside to grab  my food. Upon walking in, I was greeted by the staff who were all very friendly! My order was waiting for me on a table with my name written on it on the bag. The ordering/pickup process was seamless from start to finish. 

The menu is ""healthy Italian food.""

I ordered the ""Saporito"" salad, which is house greens, shaved fennel, grapefruit, avocado, pistachios, ricotta salata cheese with a truffle citrus vinaigrette. The salad is quite good! However, next time I'll ask for the cheese on the side. I found that there was just a little too much of it for my taste. I also ordered the grilled chicken breast as a side protein. 

From the Roman pizza section of the menu, I ordered the ""Fresca"" as well. Their delicious bread topped with fresh mozzarella, marinated tomatoes, garlic & basil and arugula. It was very flavorful! 

I wish Posto Sano was located more centrally! I'd probably go there more often. It really does offer the convenience of fast casual but high quality food.

I initially went on a Thursday, and split a diavola and a carne (both Neapolitan style) with my son. We were absolutely stunned at how good these pizzas were. Both pizzas were incredible. Good balance of sauce, cheese and toppings. The crust was crispy but not burned. Just perfection. 

I then took some people back on a Monday, and learned it was 1/2 price margherita Monday. 

Sounds like a good deal right? 

Wrong. It was insanely busy and the pizza was borderline bad. It wasn't as crispy yet somehow the edges were burnt. There was hardly any cheese and the pizza was very watery in the center. Not sure what the issue was but I have to guess they were just too busy for their own good.

Dining in was March 2021. If we had known how small the inside of Fiamme was we likely would have opted for carry out, but by the time we got there we were ready to eat. There are half a dozen tables inside and they are in extremely close quarters. My husband and I are not particularly concerned about COVID precautions, but if you are someone who is, the set up would likely be a turn-off for you.

Part of the reason we had gone to Fiamme was because of their advertisements mentioning they have vegan and gluten-free options. When we asked our server about these options, he seemed stunned, like we had just asked what color he thought our auras were. He took our drink orders and left us to investigate on our own. Luckily, after reading more into the menu, we were able to navigate to Fiamme's gluten-free and vegan options without our server's assistance.

Service was slow and our server seemed confused and/or possibly inebriated. We enjoyed the food when it finally arrived. Once our food came we never saw our server again. After about 30 minutes I went to the front counter and asked for the check.

The second time we ordered pick up in April 2021. The pies were ready on time. The server who took my payment and gave me the pies spent most of the time I was interacting with him yelling at another server he was working with. It made me uncomfortable but I was in and out of there quickly.  Again, food tasted good.

After our first visit, I came down with some gnarly food poisoning (fever, stomach cramps, intestinal distress). I generally have an iron stomach and I think associating food poisoning with a business is generally a jerk move. BUT, after our second visit, my husband came down with the exact same symptoms, which leads me to believe this may be an actual risk of eating at Fiamme.

Let's start with the good: The bone in wings are pretty legit- crispy skin, juicy meat. Pizza crust is pretty much a foldable NY style which I prefer since it's not too thick or too thin. The tots are crispy. Unfortunately, they put the ranch dressing container in with the hot tots and hot wings. So upon arrival, everything in those containers is lukewarm which is not very appealing.  The cinnamon sugar knots are very much lacking in cinnamon and sugar. The white chocolate sauce helps some. The pizza sauce is bland and the pizza crust has minimal flavor. Maybe that's why they have pizzas with crazy toppings? We just went with a veggie pizza. Overall, a pretty average experience and we are unlikely to try them again.",2/13/2021 1:27,0

I've never liked ordering supremes pizza's at most pizza shops because there's usually one or two topping I'd prefer to substitute. They've solved that by letting you pick 3M & 3V I highly recommend a: Pepperoni, ground beef, bacon, ricotta, tomato, and onion. Also their crust was delightful. I'm usually found wanting with most pizza crusts opting to drown it in ranch or marinara, but Piezano's pizza crust was too good, ranch would have ruined it. They also usually have home made cookie for sale at the register, I highly suggest getting those as well. We ordered online through their website, very convenient.",01-03-2021 09:13,1

qmRVXy4exyIvj_cqp_tmug,dQ9-MQF4oQhAOrbIhWpz8Q,SbdL-8NSmTWgSwdGZBa7WQ,1,1,0,0,"No. They were one of the better places in town, but no more. Not even close to average.

We paid $24 (a complete waste of time and money) for a 12-inch pizza. It was supposed to be a customized Bianca (mozzarella, no marinara) with: EXTRA garlic, olive oil, basil, and mushrooms. 

Simple, right? W R O N G.

What we got: mozzarella, a few mushrooms, and unnoticeable basil, visually and in taste. No olive oil, just cheese on top of pizza dough. 

One can taste both basil and garlic in a pizza, or not. This clearly was NOT for both.

Someone who is deathly allergic to garlic could've eaten this pizza with absolutely no use of an epi-pen or a trip to a local ER.

My hubby ordered at the counter to go. I'm unsure if the royal screw-up was thanks to the person at the register who was beyond clueless or the cook, but I'm thinking the buck stops with the cashier. She did not give him a receipt, wasn't wearing a mask, and when he noted the problems with the pizza, she proceeded to breathe on the pizza (REALLY???) and wave her ungloved finger way too close to point out that no, there's no red sauce. 

Bonus! Two containers of parmesan and a packet of Luigi's red peppers were thrown INTO the box with the pizza. I don't even want to fathom how many people touched those items which ended up pressed against our food. 

Here's a comparison on the price-point. A White 20"" pizza with 8 slices at Manero's on Mulberry in Little Italy (Manhattan), made with fior di latte is the same price. A larger pie made in M A N H A T T A N. Fior di latte!

Lastly, we only went here because (a) Fresco was previously fine and (b) our beloved Pizza Luna is temporarily shut down due to compliance with vaccination requirements. Also, they kindly regard both their staff and customers by masking up. I'd recommend that you pay Pizza Luna a visit once they're back as Fresco is just a Fiasco.",01-09-2022 03:35,0

The Chicken Tetrazzini was a big portion of creamy pasta and nice big chunks of chicken topped with cheese. Service was friendly.

The local ""this is a cornerstone of our downtown "" sentiment has to be the only thing that has kept the doors open. 

Let's start with the service. Absolutely some of the worst I have experienced. We were sat quickly which was nice, and then promptly forgotten about. Our waitress took our drink order, delivered the drinks and then disappeared. A different person (who did not appear to be wait staff) came back after about 20 minutes and took our food order. This would also be the only time our drinks were filled. 

Someone from the kitchen brought our food out. I had the lasagna with chicken Parmesan, my companion had the chicken tetrazzini. My dish was unremarkable but ok (nothing I would order again) and the chicken tetrazzini was so bland and tasteless that I think we used half of the salt and pepper just trying to make it taste like something other than moist cardboard. 

The price was reasonable and keeps it from being 1 star. 

The atmosphere dark dingy and so incredibly loud that I felt like I was in the middle of a packed bar. There was no possible way I was going to carry on a conversation.

Caruso's is most definitely the former, an old school place that your parents or grandparents would be very comfortable in.
When I find myself craving the basics, this is the type of place that makes me happy.
I had cannelloni made with a spinach pasta, and it was perfectly al dente, and stuffed with just the right amount of mozzarella/ricotta mixture and topped with a similarly right amount of melted cheese and sauce.
My wife was in the mood for something lighter, and found the Italian Salad to be just right.
The only quibble I had was that I found the minestrone to be a bit thin, but that could easily be a matter of taste.
Overall, Caruso's would be the kind of place I'd be a semi-regular at, if I lived in the area, and was not just visiting.",3/27/2020 6:16,1

Now I'm waiting an extra 25 minutes to get the same pizza that I ordered hoping that it Be right this time. My faith in Pizza Hut is slipping by the minute. Should've ordered from a local company instead. Check your pizza before you leave the store. I realize that this is a busy location and that times have changed. These poor people were running around frantically trying to get these orders out. What I thought was most shocking is the store manager and the district manager were both in the store at the same time I watch them while I waited and they did absolutely nothing to help their crew.

The food is ok - you're basically getting your Italian grandmother's leftovers. Can't complain, you'll enjoy in your dorm room after a bowl or two, but not something you'd rave about.

What really brings this ""Tucson staple"" down is the service. From the wait time - which turns out to be about 1/4 of what they quote you at (which should tell you something...). To the picky juvenile servers who don't understand the menu (and don't get get me started on their opinions re wine...). Lastly, good luck getting service within 15 minutes of being seated.

Unfortunately neither myself or my husband want to pay a $10 service fee because we can't get our lazy butt up and go get pizza that's 3 miles away. We called about 10 locations that were within a 5 mile radius of us  and 99% of them only deliver though postmates or grubhub. Finally, when we were about to give up on pizza altogether we happened upon  Fresco Pizzeria. There was a minimum charge for purchase to have them deliver to us but isn't it better to have $10 more of food than  pay it in a service fee? I choose food...every time. 

I believe I spoke to Nick, he was very friendly and understanding. I grumbled about my delivery complaints and he explained how  they only do their own deliveries. Sweet! 

We ordered The White Pie and garlic bread with pesto and mozzarella. The food arrived quickly, about 45  minutes later, and the delivery driver was so very nice. Really, this place hires some great people. 

Once inside I couldn't wait to open the boxes. They were still perfectly warm and the cheese was still  gooey and perfect. (See pictures) I quickly grabbed a pic (of course) then a slice and my knees almost buckled from the deliciousness. You can really taste that everything  is made fresh and from scratch. The White pie has EVOO, artichoke hearts, mozzarella, prosciutto, Parmesan, garlic, and herbs. It is the perfect pizza pie for those wanting to take a break from the red sauce. It was not dry and the crust was even delicious.

The next amazing thing was the garlic bread which we added pesto and mozzarella to. If you have a chance, and you're a cheesy pesto fan, do this! The combination of garlic, pesto, butter, and gooey cheesy  goodness was almost too much to take. When we were done we were already looking forward to our next trip to try some more items of the Fresco Pizzeria menu! Just writing this review I'm wondering what my minimum order is to have them deliver to Las Vegas...

My five stars means my palate was blown away and is continually enjoying the memory of the meal some hours after consuming it.

I had the salame pizza. At first I thought, that's pretty small for $11. But it was worth it. Every bite. And it actually turned out to be a good portion. The crust was absolutely incredible. A crispy crunch with a good, airy chew on the inside. Divine. I believe this is the best crust I've ever had in my life.

My wife had the saporito salad: house greens, shaved fennel, grapefruit, avocado, crumbled pistachios, ricotta salads, and truffle citrus vinaigrette. She also added garlic shrimp. She absolutely enjoyed it. The pistachios were genius. The grapefruit provided a bitter accent. The shaved fennel was not overbearing. She gave me a shrimp to try: Perfect. In spite of the huge size of the salad, she ate it all.

You simply MUST try the crispy potato sano tots. Oh my goodness. Each plank is hand made with something like mashed potatoes or very close to it, deep fried in olive oil, and has a wonderful, wonderful, crispy crunch on the outside and a creamy potato on the inside. An absolute delight to eat. You can get it with ketchup or the calabrian chile veganaise. (I did both.)

OK, now for the chocolate raspberry lava cake. Let's say it was a creamy chocolate pudding version of créme brûlée. This was a different lava cake as it was more like a lava with a thin chocolate crust. Raspberry sauce was around the perimeter of the baking cup it came in. It was magnificent. 

You order on touch screens. This being our first time took a little bit of time. You can customize your menu items. You can pay at the ordering kiosk or later when a waitress brings you the food. The plates, salad bowls, the eating utensils, and cups are made of plastic. That doesn't bother me one bit. We sat in the outdoor patio area. Very nice. And there are heat lamps in the ceiling for when it gets cold.

I'm going back. It's great food.

I've been to this location many times as many different restaurants over the years, and this was my first time at Proof. I would like to start off by saying the pizza was excellent, but our entire experience was less than stellar due to abysmal service.

We started off by ordering a water and iced tea for my friend. We then wanted a Frittas on the brunch menu, which we thought was something different. It wasn't bad, just not what we were expecting, so I chock that up to operator error. We specifically told the server, that we wanted an asparagus appetizer delivered after the first item, and I would tell her when to fire the pizza so things would come staggered and not at the same time. We waited a long time to get our first item, and we figured out she forgot to put that order in. We finished up the Frittas and I took a trip to the ladies room, and when I returned, the asparagus appetizer and pizza were both on the table. This is exactly what we didn't want to happen, nor what we had told our server to do. Our drinks were empty, and I had to ask for a refill. Remember, my friend had tea, but the server filled her glass with ice water, so she never got a refill of her tea. We waited and waited after we ate, painfully sitting there because we wanted to leave, and I finally had to go up to the open-air bar and ask for our check. There were only three or four other tables besides ours at the time. It was then quickly delivered, as I think they got the message that we weren't too pleased with the way our afternoon unfolded. 

I think we would have enjoyed our meal much more had the service been better, and had our needs been met. The Figlet pizza did stand out as an exceptional item. Good, chewy crust and a wonderful fig-onion marmalade. But, bad service is one thing that can keep me away from any place no matter how good the food tends to be.

 The fries are good and there's a number of ways that you can get them. The prices are really reasonable, they even offer a snack box with  a ""slice"" (half of a 12 inch pizza) and fries. 

I got the snack box and a prime lime ice fizz. The ice was worth every penny. I expected it to be a bright green, but it was white  like regular plain ice. Despite the color, it had a great lime flavor. Right now, they only have two flavors, the lime and strawberry lemonade.  While I hope that they add more flavors, I am absolutely happy to continue ordering the lime. 

The pizza is, unfortunately, their Achilles's heel. I had the plain cheese and it was not great. The crust was cracker like, the sauce was forgettable, and somehow, the cheese was watery. I may be a bit of a pizza snob, but I just expect better, even at these prices.

If I rated them for just the ice and fries, they would easily get 5 stars, but their name is *Slice* and Ice, so I had to ding them for the pizza. Honestly,  I  can see myself eating here again. A lot. Just not the pizza",02-04-2020 21:35,0

I have two suggestions for Locale. First, have the hostesses point out the white chairs where you can wait for your table. They are comfortable and situated throughout the outside gardens. Second (and this is BIG) have someone roaming these areas to take drink orders! Apparently the wait staff serves food tables and might not have ""time"" to ask if you want a drink.

We'd dined on the patio before and enjoyed it, but it was too crowded for our comfort level, so this time we called in an order to go.  We were told our order would be ready in 20 minutes.  We arrived to pick it up.  Once we finally could track down someone to ask where to pick up orders (how about a host area?), they returned several minutes later and told us it would be another 10 minutes.  No apology.  She took my credit card.  Despite the bad service, I included a tip for the to-go order.  Ok, I think--they're new, and obviously not well staffed and made an inaccurate estimate for when the food would be ready.  So instead of a 20 minute wait, it looked like it was going to be a 30 minute wait.  I can be forgiving. 

I'm waiting outside in the cold (not prepared with a jacket I was just picking up a to-go order), watching lots of people coming in, seeing them wander around inside and out for where to check-in, the lobby inside is getting pretty full of people standing around, without the required distancing.  30 minutes comes and goes, and I'm trying to find someone to check on my long-overdue to-go order.  Finally, I find a server who goes to check on it, tells me it will be a few more minutes.  I was clearly not happy, as servers came and went by me, knowing I had been waiting outside a long time.  Finally, a guy rushes by and I catch his eye.  ""How you doing?"" he asks me.  He's the manager.  ""Not well,"" I reply and explain how long I've been waiting: the 20 minute promise, the additional 10 minute promise, and the fact that I've been waiting another 15 minutes after that.  He seems irritated at me and says he'll go find my food.  

5 minutes later he comes back with my food, again no apology.  I told him it was not an acceptable wait time (25+ minutes after the 20 minutes they told me).  A good manager of a restaurant would say something like ""I'm so sorry.  We're new and obviously not prepared.  We're understaffed and our team must have given you a wildly inaccurate estimate.  I'm so sorry for the very long wait.  We'll get better and hope you'll give us another chance.  What can I do to make it up to you and leave you with a better experience?""  

This, however, was not a good manager.  Instead of an apology or any sense of understanding, the Locale manager shrugged and told me.  ""It's Friday night.  I don't know what else to tell you.""  Hmmmm.  This is the best response he could offer?  This is what I get for ordering from them on a Friday night, like it's to be expected to have a restaurant screw up and make me wait while I'm trying to support a new local restaurant?  

I won't be going back anytime soon.  I'll wait it out for a long while and hope they get better staff and better customer service.  Oh, and two of the three dishes we ordered were cold in the 4 minutes it took us to get home.",1/17/2021 1:55,0

Original founder of Eegees, has started this place and carrying forward some of his original ideas from the 70's.    Crinkle fries, icy drinks,  hero sandwiches are all good things and they get right.    

Inside isn't much to write home about, it was originally something else that they took over and made do with what was there.   Okay, it has tables, chairs, booths(though one is kind of a half booth, which you can only site one side of the table, because the table is against a wall).  

Dinner time on a Friday and it was busy, the Server greeted us friendly and said things had been hopping past few days.    Ordered a Snack box (1/2 Pizza (or Slice) and fries), 5 Meat Hero sandwich (Grinder like) and 2 Icy drinks (Lime and Strawberry Lemonade.     Menu wasn't clear but I think you can order the snack box with 1/2 of any pizza, but it just mentioned cheese).   

Icy drinks,  Very good and not sweet at all, tastes fresh.  I can not wait until they get a Lemon version  .

It was voted by the NY residents at the time to be the best place for a romantic date and also, I think, avoid a break up or something like that. It had brick decor, two small fireplaces and a small garden patio in the back.

It was wonderful, warm, the food was a perfect partner to the overall mood and is absolutely loved it.

Alas, it's the Kali Yuga and sometimes bad things happen for any reason or no reason. La Lanterna was remodeled with some sort of nouveau French cum North Korean modern art decor at some point after I left. Sad writing that.

But, from at least a Tucson perspective if not an Arizona one, Falora is the grand-niece to La Lanterna. It is small and intimate. All unnecessary elements are removed, leaving what you were there for in the first place to elevate in the proper context: the food and the company, maybe or maybe not in that order.

Proximity to the road is not an issue. Kind of nice actually. Lighting and music are perfect.

The menu is simple and understands that food is only part of the overall appeal. The pizza is closer to a European aesthetic than an American one, which is why we came. It is smaller, thinner and not overloaded with ingredients which let's the good ones used have room to breathe.

 We also had hazelnut gnocchi, which i suspect would've been warmer earlier in the evening but were still pretty good, if the only weak spot. I'd try them again. And the fact is I haven't seen hazelnut gnocchi elsewhere. Hazelnut pasta is a southern Italian thing because they cant grow wheat there but they can grow hazelnuts. Retroactive nerd alert warning.

We arrived 20 minutes before closing and were told take out only, on what clearly was direction of the owner. And I can probably understand that: he wanted to go home and was afraid we'd linger for an hour.  The waitress campaigned on our behalf I suspect because of our genuine appreciation for all the little touches - and that I was there with my son. 

Thought it was a little bit of a poor decision on the owners' part and I still do, but on the other hand it gave the simple, warm, friendly service a chance to stand out that it wouldnt normally have had. She was really, for lack of a better word, great.

I wanted my son to experience great atmosphere and napolitan pizza. He did. He wants to come back there for sure when we are in Tucson again. His new favorite place. And so we shall.

The spirit of La Lanterna lives, in the most unlikely of places.",10/21/2020 0:49,1

There was no good, rich flavor to it and large chunks of unbroken-up meat including one meatball. Bolognese doesn't not have meatballs in it.

Let's talk drinks, first of all they have aperol spritz! If you haven't been to Europe this is the equivalent of bottomless mimosas! The perfect, crisp, refreshing especially on a hot summers day. The wine selection was superb! My cab and Chianti were smooth and paired perfectly with my meal. 

The appetizers. I order bruschetta almost everywhere I go and the flavor in this bruschetta was just incredible. The serving was more than enough to share. The burrata was so creamy and fresh! 

My pasta was incredible! I ordered the Sfolgia
Hand made pasta ribbon, braised pork, mushroom, saba, dandelion greens, parmesan. It was everything and more! The flavor, the portion, and plenty of meat. I took home lunch for myself the next day! 

Lastly I had to have dessert! The tiramisu was so authentic! Not too sweet but no overpowered by coffee! Def plan to share and they're coffee was superb.

First time here we had to try an assortment of items. I must say there's a lot of potential. The pizza we ordered was the all meat pizza. Good flavor, but a little under cooked. If the crust was a little crispier and the cheese more melted they would compliment the tasty meat and sauce flavors. I would highly recommend the meatball sandwich (but you MUST add the mozzarella). Delicious bite after bite. Only 2 things keeping it from 100% perfection. 1) Again, the slightly under cooked cheese preventing perfection. 2) Yes, two (2) more meatballs PLEASE! Still, I look forward to trying again. 
After a sample of the icy, my buddy upgraded his soda to a large one. I definitely enjoyed the lemon flavored one and look forward to having a few during the hot summer. 
Like I said, I will be back. Hopefully for a more melty meal.",2/18/2020 4:32,1

I ordered a tuna salad for myself, the snack box cheese pizza for my grandson, and my husband had the pepperoni pizza and fries.  We also tried the eegees lemon/lime and strawberry/lemonaide drinks - I wasn't as fond of the drinks as I am of the regular eegees drinks, they were less sugary, and I do love my sugar!  The sandwiches looked great in the pictures, I didn't see that anyone ordered one.  Everyone seemed to be having pizza.  The fries were exact eegees fries and the ranch, best fries in town!  The pizzas were thin crust and had a good crisp to it, the pepperoni was big and thin, just the way I like it!  My tuna salad was the perfect size, and tasted great with the Italian dressing, there were pickles in the tuna, pepperinis, tomato and lettuce - perfect!

 What Hungry Howie's delivers is poor service, extremely late deliveries, cold burnt food, and bad attitudes from employees and management! Karissa the manager of this location needs to be FIRED for incompetent management and rudeness to the customers!!!!!

I mean everything- appetizers, entrees, desserts. Zero complaints. We started with the fried artichoke and the meatball appetizers. The artichoke was soooo tasty. Very light, well seasoned, and the Kevin aioli was perfect. The meatballs were also delicious. The only suggestion is the balsamic glaze was just a little dollop, it would have been nice to have more... but that fresh ricotta made up for it.

For entrees we had the chicken, sfoglia, and the tagliatelle. All were excellent. The star of the show was the polenta served with the chicken. I'm usually pretty ""meh"" about polenta, but this was remarkable. Perfectly cooked, creamy, flavorful.

For dessert we shared  the semifreddo, bonet, and tartuffo. We couldn't pick our favorite. They were all different and all delicious. The semifreddo was light and refreshing. The tartuffo we got the cherries on the side (we ended up dumpingb them on top, they were delicious). It's a perfect blend of flavor and texture. The bonet isn't really a traditional pudding, nor a mousse, as some reviewers mention. It's more the texture of a custard. We guessed that it has ricotta in it, there's a slight graininess. But after some research, discovered that a traditional bonet is made with crushed amaretto cookies. I'm guessing this one is made with hazelnut cookies.

One of the best things about this place is the ambiance. We sat on the patio. It's very relaxed. When we apologized to the server for taking up his table for so long, he told us it was no big deal, and that the owner designed it so people would feel comfortable staying for a while. He succeeded!

We began with the Spinach & Artichoke Dip, which comes with bread on which to eat it. The dip is creamy and well-balanced, with large chunks of artichoke. This isn't the cheap stuff you might get at a chain or from the grocery store; it's going to raise your standards for spinach dip. Pile the dip high on that toast and just sink into the yummy warmth! 

For our second course, we had the Spinach Salad. The spinach was generously topped with crumbled gorgonzola, roasted grapes, pickled red onions, spiced walnuts, and a balsamic vinaigrette. It was a punchy, bright salad that worked well as a follow-up to the heavier dip that preceded it. The tart and acidic elements were balanced by the candied walnuts (um, can I get a Costco-sized tub of those for snacking? Asking for... me. Yeah, I want that.) Also, the salad was enormous! It would absolutely work as a meal on its own. 

My friend and I couldn't believe we still had more food after the first two courses, but up next was the Chipotle Tomato Alfredo. The house-made fettuccini was in a chipotle cream sauce, with roasted red peppers, basil, and romano cheese; we also chose to add chicken. The sauce tasted much like a creamy vodka sauce, with a very subtle spice from the chipotle. The chicken was comparatively bland, but when eaten with the pasta and sauce was fine. 

We closed out the meal with Chocolate Flourless Torte. The dense torte came with whipped cream, pistachio brittle, berries, and a raspberry puree. The torte was nothing short of perfection. I am a huge fan of the chocolate-raspberry combination, and this was a beautifully-executed partnership of those flavors. 

It was a very good meal, and for real -- that menu will EASILY serve two.

I asked for the hoagie hot and was told it came that way - weird but great! FYI hot and toasted are different and these come toasted. Also they come with mayo.  I enjoy mayo on many things but not on an Italian grinder, that's what the house dressing used to be for.  So when I got home and went to eagerly dig in I was already disappointed as the bread was crumbling in my hands and could see the mayo on the sandwich.  I ate it anyway and it was fine but no where near what I had hoped for.  The fries were warm and salty and the ranch was plentiful.

So we ordered pizza to go. The service was very friendly and fairly quick - they had two pizzas, wings, and cheese sticks ready in about twenty minutes.  The wings were boneless and split in flavor, half parmesan garlic, half buffalo.  The flavor wasn't bad. They were a little dry, but to be fair, I have never really been a boneless wing kind of person.  I have always thought of boneless wings as basically chicken nuggets. The cheese sticks were good... nothing mind blowing, but still good.  Where they did not have quite enough of a melted cheese pull, they did add extra parmesan to the top which gave little salty nuggets that were nice.

The pizza was actually really good. We got the chicken enchilada pizza and the chorizoqueso pizza. For both pizzas, the crust at the tip of the pizza did not hold up the toppings very well and the back was a little dry.  The flavor or the crust alone was fairly balanced.  Can stand on its own flavor wise, but does not interfere with the taste of the sauce and toppings.  For the chorizoqueso pizza, the chorizo was really good. They added purple onions on top which added a nice texture difference.  You could only really taste the chorizo, but it was a really good chorizo.  I was surprised by how much I liked the chicken enchilada pizza.  It came with a white sauce that was balanced perfectly in flavor. It was what made the whole pizza. They added purple onions to this a well, but the sweet flavor of the onions balanced with the salty of the cheese, the savory of the chicken, and that perfectly balanced white sauce. 

Absolute best part of this place was that the price wasn't bad. We got enough to feed like 6 people for under $40. It was great.  When we are on this side of town again, we will definitely be getting some pizza here.",12/21/2020 22:00,1

For entrees, two of us had the panzanella (again with those amazing tomatoes), one had the chicken caesar and the other had a sandwich and fries. It was all superb with high quality ingredients. We didn't drink today, but the wine and cocktail menu looked nice and was reasonably priced. Our waiter was charming and attentive.

I have had them in the past and their quality control has completely gone downhill. I was told that my pizza would arrive at 1:06 when I ordered online.

When the pizza did come it was obvious that it had been dying in the window because the bread was so soggy I had to reheat it before my kids would eat it.

I saw photos of their outdoor space online and thought it would be the perfect spot for a socially-distanced friend meet-up - and I was RIGHT. The outdoor seating here is incredibly generous and tables are well-spaced. We visited on a warm day and the beautiful setting really makes you forget you're just off of a busy street. 

To start, my friend and I split the chopped salad (they split it into two plates for us), which was refreshing and tangy with a delicious bean spread underneath. I also ordered us some of the crispy polenta to start which was very tasty - highly recommend and easy to share.

When it came to entrees, my friend got the grinder sandwich with fries - a BIG portion, with enough to take home (she really enjoyed it) - and I ordered a slice of the roman bacon pizza, and asked to add an egg to make it brunchy. The bacon pizza is very unique, with pistachios and chopped dates added, so I loved having the egg and some salad on the side to cut a little of that sweetness of the pizza. I like roman style pizza, which errs on the side of flat-bready, & I really enjoyed my slice (& took half home since we had so many other delicious things to share - it's a nice sized slice!).

The standout for me was the TIRAMISU, which had a truly outstanding creme, light sponge, and nice & light espresso hint. We also asked them to pre-cut this in half for us, which worked great to split. It was very delicious and I'd come back just to eat this!

On the beverage side, they offer a nice wine list, a whole selection of spritzes (I really liked my Fiortentina!), and even a selection of amaros if you're looking for a post-dinner digestif. 

There's lots to like about this new spot, and I am looking forward to returning. I noticed a few weekly specials - like a burger night and a pizza + salad night - which is great!

We waited about five minutes for our food, and the people at the window were very friendly. We dug in at home and were so pleasantly surprised with how delicious everything was. I figured it would be good, but I genuinely loved everything we ordered and can't wait to go back. The pizza had a crispy thin crust and fresh-tasting toppings like onion and green pepper. The sandwich was also incredible and zesty, and I love that it comes with olives and banana peppers.

The Cioppino tomato broth was actually more like tomato sauce from a store bought jar like Prego or something.  I think it was like 3 clams, 3 mussels, small pieces of fish, and I think 2 or 3 shrimp. I was hungry afterwards but we decided on dessert elsewhere. My son had the Spiedino. He indicated the tuna was okay, but the polenta sticks were tasteless. Like no flavor at all and the greens were ho-hum. The wife had the lasagna, which actually wasn't too bad. I had a few bites because as I mentioned, was still hungry.  Different because it's not very saucy, but probably the best dish of all three items. So, 1 star for that and the other star for service.

As an Italian I usually don't go out for Italian food but this place was recommended to me as best pizza in Tucson and I decided to take my husband there for his 55 birthday. It was a Sunday and we sat outside at 5.30pm. At That time we were the only table occupied, but people slowly started trickling in. Let's start with the server, didn't ask for her name but she presented herself like she just got out of bed. The drinks were ok but, the fact I don't even remember what I have means they were not very special. My daughter had an Italian Crema Soda which was so sweet she couldn't even drink it. I had the Figlet pizza which was ok aside from the prosciutto, but the biggest disappointment was my daughter's pizza which was a margherita with prosciutto. I wish I would have taken a picture but I was in such a sock I forgot.First server said they are out of mozzarella. How can a pizza place be out of mozzarella, what was the manager doing (Costco was still open) and why the server didn't offer burrata instead, which is a type of mozzarella?! If anyone has ever eaten a pizza al prosciutto crudo ... well it definitely is not supposed to look like that. The prosciutto crudo which is an expensive Italian delicates is supposed to be cut  in paper thin sheets/strips. On the pizza that was served to us the prosciutto looked pre-chewed. Absolutely unacceptable! It was like if they put it in the blender and then sprinkled on the pizza. When I ask the server why the prosciutto looked like that she replied that it made it easier to eat. That is not true if they knew how to cut it and serve it properly. Please don't shred the prosciutto and have your server look a little more professional. Wont be back.",08-04-2021 02:08,0

We ordered two appetizers: Fried Asparagus, served with a lemon aioli, which was reasonably tasty; the other was Polenta Fries served with a tomato sauce - The polenta lacked any seasoning, compounded by the fact that there was not even a salt shaker on the table to try to make this could-be-great bite have a little depth.  The tomato sauce tasted like salt-free tomato sauce that had been spooned into a dish for service.

One of our group ordered the chicken sandwich which very large.  She said that it was enjoyable and would have the remainder for another meal.  The other diner had. Green salad topped with grilled salmon, which looked delicious and tasted the same.  I ordered the Tomato Chipotle Soup (something I really enjoy!) which was adorned with croutons seasoned with Italian seasoning - an odd contrast to the Chipotle in the soup.  The soup was tasty as we've had this at Westward Look's Gold also.  The croutons, not bad on their own were disappointing in the soup.

The service was adequate as we were probably the first customers of the day.  We left feeling quite unimpressed.

All-in-all, the sandwich, salad and soup did not disappoint, but the appetizers sadly overshadowed the merits of the Entrees.  Choose carefully.   Ask questions...and ask for salt and pepper shakers on the table! For the record, we normally do not add salt to our meals when dining out.

Shared the burschetta, which is more than enough for two people. The roasted garlic, tomato, and basil comes to the table hot and served with some warm homemade bread. Bread has a nice crust but is plenty airated  on the inside and soaks up that beautiful fragrant oil from the cast iron it's all served in. For dinner I chose the fusilli, pasta was perfect al dente and the mushrooms were hearty but a good compliment to the pasta and creamy sauce. You can add protein to this dish but I thought it was fulfilling on its own. Dessert we shared the tiramisu, I feel the picture says enough and it was. It was split between three people although we were all full we still fought over the last bites. I did try the tagliatelle and it was absolutely delicious I would recommend this dish as well! All in all it was a fantastic dinner, I would reo this place for a social gathering or family dinner.

I just moved to Tucson and had been following Locale on Instagram for awhile and I really wanted to love this place and I was slightly disappointed.  I travel for work for months at a time and usually dine alone, so therefore, I was sitting at a table alone.  It took 10 mins for someone to come over and take my drink order.  In their defense they were busy with a larger party who was apparently staying at the hotel next door.  That party was very large and they were not socially distancing and that made me very uncomfortable. They had a ton of kids with them and I don't feel like this is the type of place for a large kids party like that.   I think management could have done more to make them adhere to the current rules.  The service was friendly but very slow.  They did try to make up for the situation by buying me a glass of wine, but all in all I was really disappointed, especially after I had built it up in my mind.  I ate the burrata cheese appetizer with the prosciutto and truffle oil upgrade,  it was good but lacked flavor and I had to ask for salt and pepper.  I also had a piece of pepperoni pizza and the crust was soggy and it had a strange sweet flavor.  I also had the bread with roasted tomato and feta cheese.  It was really good, probably my favorite thing because I love feta cheese and roasted tomatoes.  I ordered the Tagliatelle to go and it really didn't wow me either.  After the servers finally acknowledged me, the service got better but the food wasn't good enough to bring me back.

I also love the aperol splitzer, another thing made to share, but I prefer to keep to myself. Obviously I love their pizza too. My pizza tastes lean towards either very classic or very unique, So I usually order the margherita or the Maré (anchovies!) or the Figaro (sauceless with figs and Brussels sprouts!). Their pizza dough is truly best in town, unsurprising considering the delicious bread. It's real Neapolitan pizza dough, slow fermented and perfectly wood fired.

Locale is the newest concept by the folks behind longtime Tucson favorite, Contigo. This midtown gem has revitalized one of the nicest restaurant spaces in town. Just north of Broadway, off Alvernon, it is easy to get to and a treat once you arrive.

You walk in to a welcoming courtyard complete with a gorgeous fountain and market lights. There are high top tables and more traditional set ups.  The menu is a great mix of delicious, simple Italian. This is the perfect spot for Tucson - and given the realities of COVID, if you are going to go out now or in the foreseeable future, this place has what you need...plenty of comfortable outdoor space, distance between tables, and thoughtful staff who look after your experience and safety.

There is a nice wine list, plenty of good beers, and -- like it's companion Contigo, excellent cocktails. 

For food - don't miss the fried artichokes. And especially don't sleep on the thinly sliced fried lemon in the mix. It may be the best appetizer I have had in Tucson. The salmon is served perfectly cooked, piping hot, and with a crispy skin. Salads are fresh and tasty. The bread is worth the splurge.

If you are in the mood for eating at home - grab a Family Style pasta meal. It's good and plentiful.

It takes courage to open a place during COVID. And it takes wonderful execution to keep a new spot busy these days. Locale delivers on all counts. It is a great spot -- for a thoughtful and safe outing or to feed the family at home.

I really wish I could give this restaurant 5 stars, but I can't. The food is 5 star worthy, but their service is at about 2 stars. 

Let's start with the pros: The food is amazing, great flavors, cooked well each time. Lots of options! Honestly, right now this is my favorite gluten-free pizza in Tucson!!! The Figlet pizza is a must try! Also, loved the Proof! The people are nice. Killer outside patio. Live music outside at least on a Saturday we went. Drinks were also good. Good distancing.

Now the cons: The service was poor. Each time the servers were super nice, but yet we had to find them in hunting down for multiple things. We were not checked on to see how we were doing or if we needed anything. The first time we were sitting inside and there were multiple servers and and at least one bartender at the bar and they were all talking amongst themselves, but yet we had to flag down our server a few times when we needed her. The second time we sat outside thinking maybe it was just a bad experience inside, but yet the same thing happened and we kept having to flag down other servers or runners when we needed something.

Our party of six was seated promptly when the restaurant opened the doors at 11:30. There are a few different rooms used for dining, as well as a patio area they use when weather permits. Friends had told us the indoor dining was very noisy, and that proved true. The room wasn't full by any means, but it was still hard to hear our conversations at times. We started with two appetizers for the table, bruschetta and fried artichokes. They were both good. We could really taste the basil in the tomato bruschetta... Yummy. The fried artichokes were also excellent. Pieces of artichoke lightly dipped in some breading and fried. Lemon aioli was the dipping sauce that accompanied the plate of artichokes. We were all intrigued by the Thursday special...a big slice of pizza and a salad for $10. We had our choice of pizza and choice of salad. I ordered the meatball pizza and a house green salad. The salad was huge and green, with fresh corn, which was a nice touch. I wasn't a huge fan of the buttermilk dressing, as it was more tart than I like, but it was ok. I was disappointed in my pizza though. The friends who ordered other pizzas had fresh, hot pizzas, while I'm fairly certain the meatball pizzas were leftover from last night and reheated. The flavor was still good, but the crust was compacted, and the cheese/meat on it pretty hard. The friend who ordered the foraged one (mushrooms) loved hers, it looked freshly made and baked. Others ordered the pear one which was the most unique pizza I've seen. They all thought it was more like a dessert pizza. Three of them had that kind and they all viewed it differently, from really liking it to not enjoying it at all. Some got the panzanella salad which was a unique combination of tomatoes, cheese, and foccaccia croutons. The service was excellent.

We went here for lunch on a Saturday on a whim. The outdoor area is gorgeous, relaxing, and a perfect area to come and hang out for a few hours. That said, we didn't have a few hours. We had one hour. So we ordered a couple slices of pizza (focaccia with toppings, really), the fried artichokes, and a sangria. The food came out relatively quickly, and the artichokes were amazing. The pizza slices (we selected the pear and margherita) were okay. I don't think I would order them again; the pear was too sweet without the right amount of acid to help balance it out, and the margherita was just a little underwhelming. The sangria was over-iced, which would normally be nice, but they don't account for that when making it, it seems. It ended up just getting a little watery after just a few sips in (and we definitely weren't just letting it sit there with the ice melting). 
Service was okay, bordering on good. Our waitress was friendly and explained the menu well. The only issue we had was when we were trying to go (again, we had a hard out after an hour), we had finished our food, and had to wait over 10 minutes to get the check (after waving her down and asking for it). And this might just be a personal pet peeve thing, but when I have to wave someone down for a check, I really hope that they understand that I'm looking to leave. It took another 5 minutes for her to run the card, so I was definitely a little impatient, as we were looking to leave. But again, definitely could just be a pet peeve thing. I know with an outdoor space and trying to go for an Italian vibe, rushing isn't quite the feeling they're going for. I'll just make sure that if we go back (because the space truly is a perfect one to go have some wine, apps, and conversation), we don't have anywhere else to go after.",5/15/2021 22:40,1

You've officially won over my heart. I have been dying to try out this new place but haven't had the time even though I live less than 3 minutes away. 

The staff was so friendly and knowledgeable I felt right at home. Kassie our server was a gem and a half and took great care of us despite my horrible day beforehand. You really can't tell how long a little bit of kindness can go. Thank you Kassie. I didn't tell you but I got diagnosed with cancer today and got denied my COVID vaccine. You made my day SOO much better. Thank you. 

The food is well balanced and well suited to the Tucson food scene. I was happy with every thing we had and can't wait to come back for more. 

I specifically asked Kassie for something that was filling and that I could eat my feelings away with and the bolognaise did just that. 

My husband could not stop talking about the pacing and the quality of the meal and he's a hard one to please.

I could eat this everyday and I do not say that often for one dish, in fact I will be going back to have it again on Sunday. The Eggplant Parmesan is another favorite, but what really makes a 5 star Italian restaurant is the sauce, my favorite Italian restaurant was in Las Vegas, small family owned DiMartinos and sons, it has always placed a high bar in deliciousness but Locale crushes it.

The food was definitely worth the wait though! We started with the roasted tomatoes and feta spread with bread, and it was AMAZING! They also sell the pizzas by the slice as well as the wholes, so we also started off with a slice of mushroom pizza.

$7 well vodka + soda w lime. Crisp and strong.
$6 Firestone
$3 Sprite for the kids
$7 Artichokes: lightly (perfectly) fried with a lemon aioli. Utterly amazing and a huge portion(!)
$15 Tagliatelle: egg noodles with bolognese may be the ingredients but I  cannot describe how delicious the sauce was. Paired with the mouth chew of fresh pasta...be still my heart!
$15 Fusilli: jumbo sized fresh fusilli in a creamy sauce with tenderly cooked mushrooms. 
$4.75 & $5 respectively for the kids pepperoni pizza and spaghetti. Both were ok for kids but it's very basic. Unapologetically, my fancy pants kids would have preferred to split a full meal. I shared mine which they also agreed was phenomenal.
$8 Tartuffo: pistachio & vanilla layered, covered in a chocolate shell and drizzled with glazed cherries. The toasted pistachios made me swoon. Great sharing dessert after our meal.

The outdoor space is spectacular, with bocce court and a very nice overall atmosphere. The service has always been very friendly. The appetizers and bread options are great. The drinks are great. The primativo is great, and so are the margaritas. 

However, when I go back I will not do the entrees again. There are a couple of good entrees but the first time I visited, I went big and ordered the ciopino. The server did, subtly, try to steer me away from that choice but I ordered anyway. Super disappointing. It was super sweet with huge chunks of carrots and not a lot of seafood. I couldn't detect and flavor of fennel. $22 is way too much money for this dish. My son had the sfolgia and it was good. The second time I ordered the fusilli with mushrooms. That was super disappointing as the dish was dry with only a very few mushrooms. 

Last night, St. Patrick's day, we took a friend for his birthday. The wait was about 45 minutes, not a worry, but we were told they were short staffed and we couldn't order from the bar while we waited. We ordered appetizers, including the calamari. The calamari was pretty good but the sauce was bland. My burger arrived after everyone else's entrees and although the server was very apologetic, I ordered MR, when it came it was MW, if not well done.

Two of us ordered the casarecce and it was super dry so we had to ask for sauce. The meatballs were nicely flavored however. One of us ordered the salmon entree which was nice and thick.

Located on Broadway and Country Club near Sushi Garden, Falora is a cozy pizzeria with the best wood fire oven pizza's I've ever had. I love the chewy texture of the crust on every pizza. They have a few patches of bitter char which compliment the sweet and tangy flavor of the tomato sauces. It has gotten a bit more expensive but still completely worth it. My current favorite one is the El fauxrizo which is kind of a mix of mexican on a pizza. It has black beans, corn, a lime avocado crema and fake chorizo. It's such a delicious Tucson twist to pizza and best of all it's guiltfree since it's vegan! I can usually have the whole pizza and still want more.

We weren't quoted a time for our table, we said first available. Then they called us that our table was ready. We waited at the host stand a while. We were with friends so it wasn't too bad waiting and chatting but after about 15 minutes we were wondering what is going on. They said someone gave our table to someone else. We waited another 15 and then got a table. It was pretty frustrating since we had little ones with us and were just left hanging up front (we felt like we were totally in the way). . I guess they said they were understaffed but that it gets that busy every night. We had really been looking forward to this night out with friends and it just felt like an awkward wait.

They told us we didn't even need a reservation so we just went. The waiter was named Brandon or Brenden. After, hostess dropped off menus; Brendan our waiter didn't stop by for 10 minutes. However, what was most frustrating was that he was standing two tables away talking to two girls the entire time.  However, he has to be one of the worst waiters, I have ever experienced. When he finally did arrive, I ask for a peach tea and my husband ordered a lager. He brought the lager back immediately, but then he went right back to the table of girls chatting and when he comes back to eventually take our order, I remind him I'm still waiting for my drink. He steps away and goes and gets the drink. So, we did ask him for a recommendation for an appetizer and we took that recommendation; which was that artichoke dip. Which was the best thing we had the entire night. So, they had a steak and seafood option or a steak. I ask size it's not on menu. he said he thought it was 10 or 12 inch's.  My husband ordered the Chipotle linguine. My husband ask him what type of chicken(add-on) how it was prepared, he said grilled and shredded. So, that was our ordered. I had the steak. Then  he spends another 10 minutes at the girls table. However, here's the fun part another 5 minutes later he comes to give me some news, mind you he has been back at the two girl table; talking for at least 10  minutes. So, here's the news, he comes back to me and says, actually the steak is only 6 in. (This is a $45 steak) So, I changed my mind. I decided to get the Chipotle carbonara. I also ordered the chicken based on description he gave my husband. I also requested a refill of my tea and he said sure ""thing boss"". However, after he put in our order he went straight back to the two top with the girls. He did not show back up at our table until dinner was here.. So, I wanted parmesan with my dinner, so I was waiting around for him to come back it took him nearly 10 minutes before he came to the table again. I reminded him that I was waiting for a refill and that I would like parmesan. He went and got the parmesan immediately and by the time he got back the chicken wasn't shredded it was actually roasted and it was extremely dry. I asked him if it was cooked to order and he said yes. That absolutely cannot be true. I told him we didn't care for the chicken and his response was ""I'm sorry"". He just walked off mind you, I still have not got my drink refill. So, we took all of the chicken off of both our pastas and just put it on a plate. Brendan walked by and shook his head, but still didn't bring my drink. I finally flagged him down and asked for a drink and at the same time he ask if I would like dessert and I said sure. Then offered to bring my drink ( I ask for 20 mins ago)  in a to go cup, I told him that was fine. We ordered a pizza cookie with gelato ice cream. He went back to the girls table and was leaning and talking to them again for 5 to 10 minutes. Here is the most frustrating part, he finally shows back up after his chit chat with my drink and he said actually we are out of gelato we could still get you the cookie though. I told him no, just cancel it. If this guy would have done his job our experience would have been a lot better. We are not someone that thinks they need to be waited on hand and foot; we just like to keep our drinks full and if we indicate that there is an issue with the food, I  would have like the server ask how they can make it right. Just don't say ""oh sorry"". (Which a solution for us, would have been just having them redo the chicken or taking the chicken back all together). There was three tables in the entire restaurant, he could have easily kept us completely taken care of and spent all of his time hitting on the girls at the two top table. He wasn't following up on our food and he certainly wasn't giving two shits about drink orders. I ended up reducing his tip giving him more than what his service was worth. (I'm a excellent tipper recommendation was 12 and I likely would have given him 21). I reduced him to $9. However, he was worth less. This is the problem when a customer that has been a supporter of this business, through food delivery and they go in and the staff drastically changes the consumer's view on the business. I find it highly unlikely we will ever eat here again in person or delivery. It would have been nice if the manager would have popped by and just ask how things were going.

The music coming from the bar was loud, heavy rock and echoed throughout the dining area, loud enough to that even though we were seated about 50' from the bar, the music was too loud for us to talk without raising our voices about 30 decibels and cupping our hands over our ears to hear the other person speak. 
in summary,
This did not have the feel, menu or taste of an Italian restaurant. Overall, it felt cheap. with the lack of atmosphere, lack of training of the waiters, lack of polish overall and too expensive for what we got. ($4.00 for a glass of iced tea in a burger joint is too much).
We will not be returning there. We like good food too much.",5/31/2021 17:50,0

The large outdoor dining area is a huge plus and all the tables are well spaced so dining feels intimate and safe.  There is also indoor seating available. We dined on a Friday evening and it was extremely busy but we really appreciated the outdoor bar and the various patio seating for waiting guest that is mixed in throughout the outdoor area. The outside bar seems to be a new feature, likely added because of the popularity of the restaurant so it is not a full bar yet. If you want your drink quicker, without someone having to go inside to get it, order what's on the board in front, those are the drinks that can be made on the spot. 

Service: Our server had a lot of tables but was knowledgeable and attentive. 

Drinks: The Aperol Spritz is a light and refreshing cocktail I'd never tried before but would definitely order again. My husband enjoyed the Italian margarita.

Food: I ordered the tagliatelle which was served in delicious Bolognese sauce.  The ribbon like pasta tasted extremely fresh and complimented the sauce nicely. My husband had the cioppino and the broth was flavorful and thick, with hearty cuts of vegetables and seafood.  We would recommend both dishes. 

So happy to have found this place! Give it a try but be prepared to wait as it's only going to get more popular and unfortunately, they are not currently taking reservations.",05-03-2021 02:02,1

When I arrived at the restaurant to pick up my order, I was informed by the hostesses that the restaurant's internet system was down, and that the restaurant had not received the order. So I was invited to sit and wait and additional 30 minutes while my order was prepared.

When it was finally brought out, I was informed that I needed to pay (again), due to their internet problems, even though I had submitted payment through Upserve.

Today, Tuesday August 31, I checked my credit card info and I see that I have been charged twice for the same meal.  I will be contacting the restaurant directly to attempt to address this, but I do not hold out much hope, given the poor service on Saturday evening.",8/31/2021 16:33,0

Perhaps it is someplace in the vicinity of Stouffer's, for the lasagna is almost as good as that frozen variety--not quite but almost. The meatballs reminded me more of the Basque region, not the wonderful Basque food but the pelota, the hard rubber ball used in the sport of Jai Alai. Then there was the grilled radicchio, which was not something I want to ever again go near. Suffice it to say, this was not a good meal. So, why three stars? The setting. It's really lovely.

I think they have a really well-rounded and interesting menu, the food is generally a very high-quality and well-prepared, and the atmosphere is very relaxed, warm, and inviting.

That being said, out of the three restaurants in the St. Philip's Plaza, Proof consistently has the slowest and poorest quality of service. We've had some unbelievably long wait times for food and have been/have seen smaller parties be almost completely ignored by wait staff to provide service to larger parties. I'm not sure if this is a reflection of poor training or simply not having enough staff, because the waiters have generally been very kind when they do make it to your table.

Proof is a spot that's popular for after-work get togethers, so if you are planning on going, your best bet for better-than-normal service might be during lunch or early afternoon. And if you do go, don't miss out on the made -in-house burrata!",05-08-2021 23:00,0

It is low dimmed and has plenty of tables for small and big groups. 
Thursdays there a deal for $10 that includes a pizza square w a salad. This was definitely enough for a meal and fills you up. Bc we are such foodies and love leftovers we ordered more! The half chicken was really tasty, juicy and very savory, broccolini was a great touch, it has a risotto side which is nothing too crazy but it does balance the chicken well. We also had the Tartolini (sp?) Pasta and it was great but nothing too different from like a bolognese. Very safe dish to try if you're not feeling too adventurous. GET THE FRIED CALAMARI!!  They make it really great here, it's very fresh and has a touch of spicy that gives it the extra item for me to recommend it.
I had the mama cocktail and tbh it's like a blander version of a mule... wasn't my favorite. The glass of Chianti was great!

BAD SERVICE, BURNT FOOD AND BAD ATTITUDES!!!!!!
*Update and District Manager's name & number below!*

 I've been a loyal customer and huge fan of Hungry Howie's Pizza for over 30yrs in 3 different states. I've recommended Hungry Howie's to friends, co-workers and complete strangers. After my experience today at their location at 3122 N Campbell Ave in Tucson, AZ I'll never waste my money with this company again.
 I placed my order on the mobile app. The Howie tracker said it would be 40mins for delivery. The Howie tracker then showed after 40mins that the order had been already delivered, but never arrived. So, I called the location the order was placed at and spoke to the manager, Karissa, who told me that my order had just left, which was already beyond the 40min delivery window. My order finally arrived a full hour and 25mins after I placed it on the mobile app. I called the store #01828 back and asked to speak to the manager and got Karissa once again. When I complained that my order took twice as long as the app stated, as well as the store's failure to call me and let me know the driver was running late. Karissa just wanted to make excuses for her lack of management and poor scheduling. When I asked for the District Managers Name and office number, I was told that that information couldn't be given out. I've been ordering from Hungry Howie's for more than 30yrs now, from three different states, Michigan, California and Arizona, and have recommended it to friends, co-workers and complete strangers as my all time favorite pizza place. That ended today with this abortion of an experience. This was my last order and I will let everyone know how Hungry Howie's treats their loyal customers!
 What Hungry Howie's delivers is poor service, extremely late deliveries, cold burnt food, and bad attitudes from employees and management! Karissa the manager of this location needs to be FIRED for incompetent management and rudeness to the customers!!!!!
 How much more damage to Hungry Howie's will their Corporate office allow this disgraceful store to do? Hungry Howie's Corporate office needs to Fire the entire management staff at this store due to their extremely poor customer service performance.

Update 6-16-20: 
 So 32 days after the above incident, I finally get a phone call from Hungry Howie's District Manager, Mike Nathanson. Mr Nathanson said that he had had tried to call me previously but only got my ""full"" voicemail mailbox. The problem with that is that I never received that supposed call and my voicemail mailbox never has more than one voicemail at a time. Especially since I delete every voicemail after receiving it and listening to it. I don't know what number Mr Nathanson called that supposed first time, but it certainly wasn't my only phone number that's on my customer order information on Hungry Howie's computer system. Mr Nathanson did say that he had had a hard time getting the number he called me on, my only phone number. 
 The the entire management at Hungry Howie's on Campbell is so Morally Bankrupted, that if you lodge a complaint with their Corporate Office, they'll change your phone number in their computer to prevent their Corporate or District Office from contacting you. The entire management at Hungry Howie's on Campbell is so Morally Bankrupted, that they complete your order as delivered in their computer long before it ever even leaves their store to hide from their Corporate and District Offices that it's taking them 2 to 3 times longer than it should just to deliver your food. Look at my initial review above as well as other reviews that talk about deliveries taking extremely long to get delivered. It's not just my personal experience. My 2nd call to Hungry Howie's Campbell Rd was because the mobile app showed my order had already been delivered and Karissa said the driver was just leaving with my order still not arriving for another 45mins.
 Bottom lines, if you have any problems with your order, call the District Manager-Mike Nathanson at 602-492-4473",6/20/2020 3:41,0

Our Super Bowl plans fell through and we didn't want to cook as the grocery store was going to be packed  We drove by this new place and asked my hubby about trying it out! The title and colors caught my attention   We went inside and noticed they had a $5 Super Bowl pizza special! We ordered the special, the meat one and two lime Italian ice! ****REMINDER: This place was opened by the Eegees founder and former owner so there are a few similarities!****

Their Italian ice reminded me of the delicious Eegees but less sugar which I loved! It is an option for those who enjoy eegees but have health concerns and can't consume much sugar. 

The pizza is what you pay for! They are very delicious for the price :) I had to save a few slices as it filled us up for sure! The pizzas you order there are 12 inch personalized ones so be careful on ordering! 

Overall, our visit was great and we wIll FOR SURE be coming back :)

The pizza fries is just too much pizza flavor in one box and hot ranch is good as well! I found the garlic perfectly compliments the pizza and goes well together and gives it more variety.

There are always good coupons, either in the mail or online, so pricing is great.

I just like their flavor. Their crust is good, sauce is good, and they put on a good quantity of toppings. When compared to all the other chains, Blackjack does it best, in my opinion. Pizza Hut is what it is and is acceptable. Dominos is the worst pizza on the planet. Little Caesar's is only good when hot and fresh, otherwise is just a small step above frozen pizza. Papa Murphy's marinara has a strange flavor to me. Papa John's is OK, but kind of greasy and, I don't know, has a ""manufactured"" taste to me. Blackjack is the King of chains for me, although that is a contradiction since they are a Jack. ;)

***UPDATE 2/13/20

Had the deep pan pizza for the first time. I really like it! The crust is really good. Nice and crunchy and unlike others' deep dish, this one is not greasy. There is a ton of cheese on it. Only three pieces did me in. I recommend it.

Just scratching my head over the labeling/marketing because on the box and on the menu it says it is ""square pan"" but it definitely is a rectangle. LOL Regardless, good value and tasty, too.

5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money.

4* = Outstanding. Tucson-top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business.

3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it.

Upon entering Locale, you will immediately notice the warm ambiance of the restaurant. The courtyard area holds many nice outdoor seating areas that are well-lit and well-heated with gas heaters in the colder months. Of course, if you're looking for sheltered indoor seating, there are many nice options inside as well, though you may need to wait longer for these seats (no reservations, first come first served only). However if you do find yourself waiting for table, the wine bar in the back is a cozy space you can hang out at in the meantime.

Honestly, the ambiance makes up for where the food is lacking (for the pasta at least). The spaghetti (with clams) sounds nice, but the execution was lackluster. The pasta wasn't seasoned enough, and tasted as if it just came straight out of pasta water. The same can be said of the fusili.

Our Margheritta pizza was good: thin with a well baked crunchy crust, a smidgen of basil leaves and a few tomato slices; but it's not calling me back for more. My sangria was good, but nothing exceptional. My other half had a blood orange margarita. It was incredibly tart. We also had is simple salad. And yes it was quite simple. It was bagged leaf lettuce with four chunks of heirloom tomatoes along with a few tiny chunks of cucumber. On the menu, they say it comes with pistachio brittle. The brittle in the salad was teeny tiny slivers of sweet crunchy candies. On my pallet it didn't fit. I didn't taste any nuts so I picked them all out.

But it's the service that topped everything. The waitress was very polite. However she was absorbed with some sort of inventory device of some sort; and she along with another server were absorbed in a show on the TVs above the bar. It all resulted in me having to go up to retrieve her several times, first to order and then to get our toppings, and finally our check. She never asked if we wanted another drink or desert.

I feel like I almost jinxed myself though. The girl at the front had a very bad attitude,  She seemed upset that I showed up 15 minutes later than I said they would. I  apologized half heartedly as I genuinely didn't understand what the big issue was since I was still paying for my food. (I figured I'd just reheat it) but then I immediately told my husband that we HAD to make sure to bake it because I was scared she did something to the pizza.
Lo and behold, we had to bake it anyways because it was raw 
I reached out to my friend to see if I should call and ask for a future pizza credit and he immediately says, ""Oh no, just suck it up. You don't want to get another pizza from that place after they've written your name down!""

Wth?!?  I don't care how good the pizza's ever been for anyone, I don't know why anyone would recommend a place that they feel would be so shady in handling food. ‍  But I am telling you that I definitely do not recommend this place.",9/17/2020 17:49,0

I was one of a party of four.  Each of us ordered something different.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was really good.  The (overpriced) casarecce is just pasta and red sauce with two very small meatballs.  The house green salad with chicken was fine but didn't look fresh.  The salmon was easily the best dish we ordered, and the ""broccolini"" was mostly inedible.  It was broccoli, not broccolini.  The florets were tasty but the stems were too tough and woody to eat.

The atmosphere and service were good but the food was pitiful. I've never eaten a meal from start to finish with so many dishes prepared incorrectly. The theme of the night was OVERCOOKED and when I say overcooked, I mean absolutely HAMMERED. The calamari was so overcooked and gummy to chew, my salmon was sooooo overdone that the end was crispy like a salmon chip (the thought of that bite makes me cringe), and the apple tart looked and tasted like it had been cooked awhile ago, then reheated but was so reheated and stale that we couldn't even cut into it. I would question the quality of any of the fish here, as it was either the preparation, the quality, or both. Yet, the salmon fish costs almost $20 but the piece of fish could've been on my plate at a chain restaurant and I wouldn't have known different. I felt bad because our server was nice and my husband and I were just so thankful and happy to be away from our kids, we didn't complain much but the salmon was taken off our check. They don't take reservations, so waiting 50 minutes for poorly cooked food, just isn't right. I probably wouldn't go back unless I was going for cocktails and the bread that cost $3. Even still, the marg on the menu was just fine. Nothing more, nothing less. 

Edited: I forgot to mention how filthy the bathroom was here! Omg..... FILTHY. My husband said his was bad too. I had to go twice. The second time there was a literal dirty tampon applicator on the floor. No one is checking the bathrooms here or whoever's job it was the night we were here absolutely did not check it.

I have moved to Phoenix and come to Tucson about once a month and this is a place I want to go on every visit.  Now I need to make sure that my trips down don't fall on a Monday as Locale is closed on Mondays. 

I have been twice now and had the taglietelle both times. I have a pet peeve with Italian restaurants that skimp on pasta when it's really not a pricey item for them to be generous with. Both times I have enjoyed a meal here, I had enough leftover for either a late night snack or an entire other dinner. 

I also really enjoy the freshly baked bread with olive oil for just a few dollars. But now I know that I need to put in the order for that as soon as I'm seated so I can snack on it while I wait for my pasta dish. 

I also appreciate that they have a very nice outdoor seating area. It was just starting to get cool when I last went and I was told that the heaters will be brought out soon.

Customer Service = Horrible!
     We had an early dinner here a few nights ago with another couple - our second visit to Locale.  First time the food was great, this time not so much.  More about the food later.  Our separate checks came and they were totally incorrect, so the server ran them again.  This time they were still incorrect but not as badly so we just gave the other couple cash for some of our items that ended up on their check.  Next day we check our credit card charges and find that each couple was charged for the other couple's meal.  I start calling the restaurant at 10:30 to address the issue, thinking this is a good time to call since they don't open for business until 11:30.  Wrong . . . they simply don't answer the phone and calls are automatically disconnected after several rings.  I finally get through to the manager about 1:00 and he's really annoyed that I'm calling during lunch service.  Duh . . . answer the phone before your lunch service!  I give him both of the credit card numbers and tell him which amount should go on each card.  He says he'll take care of it later in the day and call me back.  It's now 3 days later and the charges are still incorrect and I haven't received the promised returned phone call.
     
     Now onto the food.  One couple had the chopped salad which they thought was pretty ordinary and they wouldn't order it again.  They also had a calamari starter which they ate with no comment.  He had the Sfoglia (braised pork pasta dish) for the second time and loved it just as much as on our first visit.  She had spaghetti with clams - disastrous!  First time around half of the clams hadn't opened up in the preparation, so the closed clams were returned to the kitchen.  Second time around half of the clams were still not open.  This dish was removed from the bill.
     We started with a Panzanella salad.  The tomatoes were good, the mozzarella was completely mushy (almost the texture of ricotta).  The pesto sauce was overwhelming and there were almost no greens, so it looked like everything was floating in a puddle.  We also had 2 different ""pizza"" offerings.  The mushroom and truffle pizza was just ok, the pear and gorgonzola was excellent.   We chose Sfoglia for our entree and thought it was excellent.
     Bottom line:  Some of their food is really good, some just mediocre.  The outdoor seating is lovely - by all means opt for al fresco dining if you can.  Indoors is nice but the noise level can be way over the top if they are crowded.  This restaurant is nearly an hour drive from our home and after our first visit we said it was worth the traveling time.  This experience left us with mixed feelings, but the mishandling of the charges has us leaning toward passing on spending 2 hours traveling just for dinner.  There are a whole lot of restaurants with excellent food between us and them - I think it will be a long time before we return to Locale.",11-05-2021 17:09,1

Burrata ($13.00) + prosciutto ($6.00) - 3.5/5 
A little on the pricey end for what was given.. maybe for Tucson this place is a bit high-end, but I considered it fairly average with a nice decor and chic high desert vibe. The fresh green olive oil was great, but a little too much was added so it soaked the rest of the dish. Tomatoes were fresh (and local I believe). $6 for a few slices of prosciutto though? I'm expecting some butcher top notch slices. It's meh. The focaccia bread brought along to eat appetizer with was underwhelming and slightly undercooked, but was served warm. 

Tagliatelle ($15.00) 4/5
Noodles are cooked perfectly al dente and the bolognese sauce was cooked well but could've used a little more salt & bite. Served EXTREMELY hot, so do blow when you're eating it. The portion is LARGE. highly recommend ordering 2 dishes and splitting it family style and you'll still have leftovers. And trust me, a girl can eat

A little slow to take my order, but a waiter I want to specifically point out (glasses and wears high top vans) made sure I was taken care of with utmost expertise. Answered all my questions and apologized for the wait. Also checked in twice to make sure my food and drink was up to expectation.

Being new to Tucson, I'm still trying to find good food places so I was excited to come across this place on Yelp with great reviews. I noticed they closed at 9p and the clock read 8:17p. I decided to order something simple since time was close and didn't want to be an inconvenience. 

I ordered a Margherita pizza and Caprese salad through their online website and the confirmation email said it would be ready at 8:35. It seemed quick, so I thought I would give them a little time because sometimes online orders ETA can be off. I arrive about 5 mins to close and I can tell my order wasn't ready. 

Apparently their online system wasn't printing out tickets and they had no idea about my order. They have an open kitchen, so the pizza cook could clearly be seen and heard. It was so bad that I just asked to cancel the order because I knew by her reaction my pizza wouldn't be made with love and care. The cashier reassured me everything was ok and they would have my order out shortly. But the pizza cook was clearly annoyed, so I asked once more to just cancel the order and not to worry about it since the order wasn't even made. However, the cashier once again said they would have it out and tried to smooth things over by explaining it's just been a busy day and my order wasn't the first to be missed due to the online system. If it weren't for her, I probably wouldn't have taken no for an answer.

Not even 5 mins later, my order is ready but they didn't have basil (for a margherita pizza) so I okayed them swapping for spinach. Trust me, this review would've been so much different if the customer service wasn't what it was. Instead of apologizing to me for not having the order ready or being out of ingredients, I felt like I was the one who was apologizing. The nail in the coffin however was the pizza!

We ordered two appetizers: Fried Asparagus, served with a lemon aioli, which was reasonably tasty; the other was Polenta Fries served with a tomato sauce - The polenta lacked any seasoning, compounded by the fact that there was not even a salt shaker on the table to try to make this could-be-great bite have a little depth.  The tomato sauce tasted like salt-free tomato sauce that had been spooned into a dish for service.

One of our group ordered the chicken sandwich which very large.  She said that it was enjoyable and would have the remainder for another meal.  The other diner had. Green salad topped with grilled salmon, which looked delicious and tasted the same.  I ordered the Tomato Chipotle Soup (something I really enjoy!) which was adorned with croutons seasoned with Italian seasoning - an odd contrast to the Chipotle in the soup.  The soup was tasty as we've had this at Westward Look's Gold also.  The croutons, not bad on their own were disappointing in the soup.  I also ordered the White Bean Bruschetta which was serveed cold.  It consisted of plain white beans mashed onto the cold bread.  No seasonings, not even a drizzle of EVOO.  It, too, was very disappointing.

The service was adequate as we were probably the first customers of the day.  We left feeling quite unimpressed.

All-in-all, the sandwich, salad and soup did not disappoint, but the appetizers sadly overshadowed the merits of the Entrees.  Choose carefully.

It was going to be at least an hour until we got seated. Okay, no big deal. Haven't seen her in almost two years, so catching up is good. A drink would have been nice, as it seems like all these stunningly beautiful people are walking around with a delicious Aperol Spritz in hand. No one asked us if we wanted anything, even while bringing drinks to the large group standing uncomfortably close to us. (Aunt C had asked someone at the outdoor bar for something when she got there, but no dice.) 

We did get seated eventually, and were able to move away from the large crowd standing less than a foot in front of me. (Out of my bubble!) Fortunately we were seated quickly after that, and drinks were ordered promptly. I thought about an Aperol Spritz, as they are delicious and my sister got me hooked - but had an aranciata instead. Mmmm. Aranciata. 

I had the burger (very good) which came with a mountain of truffle fries. I also thought about the spiedino and the chicken (both coming with polenta, which I absolutely love). DH had the fusilli, which he really enjoyed, and Aunt C had the Caesar with salmon, which she said was good although the Caesar dressing was very anchovy heavy.

We also got the Mozzarella sticks, now knowing we only really needed 1 appetizer, and was fantastic as well. 

We decided to split the Red Dragon Calzone. It was marinara, provolone, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, sausage and bacon. We weren't sure if they would be enough to split and yes there was plenty. We're actually taking some home as well.

Jaime said a 4 because of the time it took, 20 minutes, to get our order out. I say it was totally worth it.

Turkey and feta salad I ordered tonight was small, had very few of the mix ins, missing almonds entirely and had the avocado smashed in there as a big hunk (normally it's nicely cubed). Chicken and broccoli pasta was awful. Hardly any cheese sauce and was very bland. Pasta also had two pieces of broccoli and maybe one good piece of chicken. 
Tonight hasn't been the only time my order has been disappointing - a few months ago when I ordered the roasted veggie salad it was completely wilted and the veggies were soggy. I didn't even finish my meal. 
I gave the extra star because when I did call about my order tonight they offered me a free entree on my next visit. Not sure if I'll be back considering how lackluster my last few orders have been, but I appreciate their gesture.",1/23/2021 3:41,0

Robert was our server, and was attentive and polite. He told us up front that the pizza would take 25 minutes.  We ordered the lunch specials of antipasto salad and personal pan pizza.  The salad was delicious, the plates were ice cold and it and more than enough for two people.  When the pizza arrived it was luke warm and had obviously been sitting for awhile.  The pizza was ok, not really noteworthy but filling.

They serve giant slices and you're welcome to add custom toppings. The crust is perfectly thin and crisp,, holds a great body for itself! A great value. The customers service is always relaxed and friendly and polite. Also you've got to try the garlic knots! The best I've ever eaten. They come with enough for 2-5 people, (my boyfriend and I can crush a lot of carbs quickly between the two of us!) and they come generously coated in butter and fresh garlic. I can't stand any bread product that is too dry. Upper Crust does not skimp on the good stuff! AND to top it off, their ranch to dip it all in is 5star. Fantastic ranch!!

My husband the F&S burger - burger with pulled pork, green chiles, pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, and sauce on a beautiful pillowy bun.  Holy heckabeans it was good and juicy and devoured.
I had the special - the Farlow's revenge - 1/2 lb angus beef patty, smoked rib patty, bacon, housemade spicy pickles, grilled onions, pecorino truffle cheese, F&S sauce, and spicy chipotle sauce all on that beautiful bun.  Insanely flavorful and messy - just as a burger should be.

We took our two granddaughters and the next door neighbor's daughter to dinner there
last fall. They got my order totally wrong, made smaller mistakes in my husband's order and one granddaughter's order, and never brought the salad we ordered. When we brought it to the server's attention she acted like she didn't care and was rude about making it right, *suggesting we didn't remember what we actually ordered*. 

And the salad we finally got and my husband's meal were just meh...

My granddaughter takes forever to eat, so while she was still working on her meal I asked to speak to the manager. 

The girl went into the back and came out again. A few minutes later still no manager, and no explanation.

I asked again, and was told the manager was busy in the back and would be out soon.

*20 minutes later* he finally came out - after I complained AGAIN (what was he doing back there that couldn't be interrupted, brain surgery? Couldn't send someone out to let me know why he wasn't available?) - and he also seemed like he didn't care that any of this happened, but did refund my meal after I insisted.

We went for lunch on a weekend, right around 12:30 and seating was plentiful, including a nice outdoor area. You order at counter and they bring to you. It takes a bit to get your food, but that's cause they don't start till you order, including for the pizza slices.

And I say slices, because even though it says pizza slice, you get two huge slices. They said it was on par with a Costco slice, but I say it was bigger.

The positive: The food arrived on time and the large styrofoam container was heavy - a good sign! I opened the box and found it brimming with fries and plump meaty wings. More good signs. I moved some wings to a plate, licked my sticky fingers, and loved the sweet spicy sauce. It could have been a bit hotter but the flavor and balance were good. 

The not-so positive: Although the wings were still hot, the fries were cold and tasteless. They desperately needed seasoning but chilly fries will never be good and I wasn't somewhere I could toss them into the oven for a heat up. Fries do cool quickly. Perhaps the solution would be to offer cole slaw or a side salad for delivery customers. 

The biggest problem, however, was that the wings were underdone. Several were quite pink at the bone and had the chewy consistency expected from chicken done under.  The skin was flaccid rather than crispy. The large drumettes were the biggest offenders but a couple of the flats were pink as well.  Very disappointing.",10-09-2021 02:55,0

After some research, all signs pointed to Rocco's Little Chicago.  Located along Broadway, Rocco's offers a variety of styles of pizza - including deep dish - along with the intriguing option for a second crust on top of their pizzas.  Having a fairly low tolerance for tomato sauce, I ordered a deep dish white pizza with mushrooms, and with the second crust on top.  Since I was getting take-out for just myself, I ordered the smallest size possible: the 9"" pizza.  Holy cow, I didn't even make it through half of the pizza, it was that filling.  I liked the taste, although I have to say that a deep dish white pizza is a little overwhelming without having the contrasting taste of the tomato sauce.  I think next time in town, I'll try a lightly sauced pizza with the tomato sauce... and maybe try to get one by the slice!

Placed my last order with them yesterday and will not order again from them as it was also inaccurate. It was one of their new specialty pizzas and it had hardly any cheese on it and missing pepperoni did not have any flavor or taste in the pizza. I'll not be ordering pizza from Papa John's again. They can't seem to do it right. Pizza is a pretty basic food and if you use flavorful ingredients you'll get a quality taste. Also, they're more expensive than any other pizzeria in my local area.

bh-DttHBj46cBGtO9Mo6Rg,ko4kjJpPLpB604LMXVpIGA,lMmlIy_J5o-D9l6XNR7Erw,4,1,0,0,Got a pepperoni and jalapeño pie here twice while we stayed at the Pima County Fairgounds. Me and hubs both loved it. They've got some pretty solid ranch as well which I'm assuming is house made. I know it's controversial but one of my requirements for enjoying pizza is for it to be served with some dang good ranch dressing and they didn't disappoint in that regard. Both times ordered ahead and picked up and didn't wait more than 2 minutes either time. Pretty reasonably priced and good service (at least for to-go...COVID19). Pizza was really good and while it might not be prized by true connoisseurs it sure as heck beats what you'd get if you went to any of the national chains. I'll definitely continue to spend my money here any time I'm in Tucson.,4/23/2020 18:38,1

This last week I placed an online order for a small pizza with three toppings and an appetizer. The website specified what time pick up would be available and I arrived at that time to pick up my order. I was told that it would be an additional 10 to 15 minutes so I sat down and waited. After about 12 minutes I picked up my order. Got home and try to piece of the pizza and a couple of the breaded mushrooms. The pizza had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The pepperoni was very mild, the sausage had no spices. I have ordered this combination before at this restaurant and it was usually pretty good. This time for some reason I can only give them two stars. I realize that Service has changed in this time that we're all going through, but that's why we order online so we don't have to wait very long. I guess the recipes  Have changed It taste more like cafeteria food now, something that old people would like. But wait, I am an old person. I guess that's not the reason after all.

They will send you out to hit an ATM and come back.while I understand they limit your ability to enter for pick up to one at a time, the idea of running to get cash and going back to a line was very inconvenient. 

 2. And this one is huge for me. I Ordered over the phone for a bolognese sauce which was on the menu. They accepted my order. I came in and the owner said yeah meat sauce. I repeated bolognese. Hey very sternly told me that is meat sauce. He advised me to tell the young people who seemed confused meat sauce because that's how they know it. But it was bolognese. Considering his wife owns Basils fine Italian dining, this was very sad. 

When I arrived it was a meat sauce, a ragu. I personally make bolognese, I often order bolognese, and I know enough to to know the difference. I consider those tactics underhanded, misguided and a demonstration of either the owner's willingness to deceive or lack of understand of common Italian foods. 

He lost me as a customer. I was bring the food to show off to friends who would be future patrons who are not impressed. And considering I got pizza over the years from them I am very disappointed to have to share this. I personally support local shops and restaurants.

The basics: The business location was decent and from the looks of the inside, it looks clean. The staff were also friendly. The wait was quite long, too. We were told it would be ready in 45 minutes and after 95 minutes, our name was called for our order.
The order: Deep dish combination pizza and spaghetti with two meatballs. The pizza was ""deep"", but mostly doughy instead of full cheese and meat like most deep dish pizza establishments we're accustomed to. Nonetheless, it was tasty. The spaghetti with meatballs were a hit! The meatballs were seasoned great and quite moist. The only down side to the spaghetti order with meatballs was the size of the meatballs, which were relatively small for the huge helping of spaghetti pasta given for the order -- let's just say the balance between the two was off.

I came for the BBQ, and tried as many things as I could fit inside my 5'1"" frame. Pulled chicken, tri tip, Cole slaw, baked beans, a bite of Mac 'n cheese, and RIBS! The chicken was sauced, not too sweet, and just the right amount. Tri tip was tender, full of smoky flavor, and came with a wonderful horseradish sauce for a good smother. The sides that accompany Q are just as important as the meat is, in my humble opinion. The Cole slaw was excellent. One of my favorite sides with Q, and finding a good one isn't easy. Look no further. This was balanced perfectly. Crunchy, lightly dressed, and with just a hint of sweetness. Just the way I like it. I did add a touch of my own Maldon sea salt, but that's perfectly fine with me. Now about the Mac 'n cheese. This is one of the first times I've ever seen WHITE Mac 'n cheese. I have an aversion to yellow cheese. I equate it with cheese out of a bag, or pressed between saran. He starts with a garlic Alfredo sauce, then adds more cheeses for flavor and the result is a light and refreshing texture. No clumps here, and I so wanted to have more, but it was on someone else's plate. After this first wonderful plate of food, I had to try the ribs. They came with the sauce on this side, but these didn't need any enhancement because the rub on them is so good. Smoked to perfection, then flash-grilled for service. Don't skip these. So perfectly cooked that they were fall off the bone with the bite of your teeth, not because they were foiled for too long, or ""cooked"" in sauce to make them tender. This guy knows how to smoke meat. Some friends of mine are going later today, and I just may have to make another trip! Twice in one day sounds just about right.

We had the pleasure of having the owner and his brother as our hosts/servers. They were both delightful and super nice. You can tell they love what they do here. 
A friend recommended this place to us for some great Italian food and it was great.
We each had something different (see receipt) and everyone loved their dish. I had the Spaghetti Carbonara which was excellent! Very filling and sprinkled with pieces of lean pancetta. I had to eat the rest the next day as this was very satisfying. 
The owner took the time to speak to the people at the tables and even offered us some chilled homemade Limoncello at the end. It was pretty darned good. 
They offer a selection of Gelato at the front counter that looked very tempting but we were all too full to partake and promised we would return another day for that treat. 
Everyone here practiced social distancing due to the pandemic and there was available outdoor seating if desired. Give this place a try when in the area, you won't be sorry. I definitely will return here another day and will have the gelato then!

So I'm not putting it down. Something has changed. Maybe the owner I don't know.

The employees here have NO CLUE about how to make a pizza with LIGHT sauce OR, more importantly, HOW TO TREAT THE PEOPLE WHO FUND THEIR PAYCHECKS!  We've had this SAME problem for MORE than two years now and while we are normally not paranoid people, we are completely convinced they have flagged our phone number to give us the MOST INFERIOR (TAKE OUT) EXPERIENCE EACH AND EVERY TIME WE CALL IN FOR PIZZA!!!

We have complained to the management in Phoenix (in the past), and they were gracious enough to provide a gift card for our inconveniences, but we called in our order for a thin crust, LIGHT SAUCE, PEPPERONI pizza yesterday afternoon, waited the 35 minutes to have it made THE WAY WE ORDERED IT and baked, then picked it up and brought it home only to discover it wasn't pepperoni AT ALL - it was cheese and was LOADED with sauce!  

Upon calling to return the pizza II spoke with the manager, Becky, who seemed apologetic (I say ""seemed"" because when we actually took the wrong pizza back so we could pick up the replacement pizza (that, yes, we had to wait MORE time to have baked), she became combative when I pointed out that it, too, had way too much sauce (so much that it was oozing off the outer crust).  

While we have boycotted them in the past for these same infractions, it seems our only option now is  NEVER ORDER PIZZA FROM THIS LOCATION AGAIN!  

Clearly this restaurant and its staff and management CONTINUES to need appropriate training in pizza preparation with LIGHT SAUCE, as well as training on appropriate customer-centric attention to detail.  

But, hey, there's plenty more customers out there who just don't give a rat's rectum what they eat and will accept whatever is given to them.  We are NOT those customers.  We are the customers who WANT what we ORDERED, and who want what we PAY FOR!

That way customers know to decide on those options right away. Or have your servers present those options with the wait times when they take drink orders. We ordered the stuffed pizza to go after our server told us it would take 90 minutes. We really wanted to try it as it looked and sounded delicious. Ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich to eat with the rest of my party in the restaurant. Everyone's food came out and I was still waiting on my sandwich. My sister shared her salad with me because I was the only one not eating. I asked the waitress if the sandwich should come out before the pizza since that was the point of me ordering it, she said yes the sandwiches usually come out quick and your pizza should be done in about 10 minutes. She asked if I wanted her to just cancel my sandwich and remove it from the bill. I said yes since I ate off other plates in my party and everyone was already eating done. My pizza did in fact come out before my sandwich. Was still charged for the sandwich and they put it in a to go box. Told the waitress we didn't want it to please take it off the bill since the point was to eat it in the restaurant with my party. She gave me a very snooty side smile and walked away with the bill and the box. The whole meal she took a very long time to bring refills. When we asked for a refill one of the times because she forgot I guess she responded ""yes, but give me a minute."" And it was not a nice tone she used. This is not the first time we have received bad service here. It's close to my house which is convenient and I love the food but I think I would much rather drive the 45 minutes to the Speedway location where the service is always excellent, the portions seem bigger and the staff is nicer.",7/18/2021 21:22,0

I hung up after about a minute because I thought that was extremely poor customer service right off the bat. You should always ask if someone could hold, not just put them in the queue. 
 My boyfriend called two minutes later and his order was taken promptly. We ordered a 12 inch pepperoni pizza and the pound of tysonized wings for around $32 and 40 minute delivery quote. 
The food showed up a bit early, and the driver was pleasant, but the pizza had slightly slid forward in the box. As pizza restaurant employees we get that this can happen, and that certainly wasn't our problem with the order. The problem was there was little to no sauce on this pizza. It was so cheese caked that you couldn't pull a slice from the pie because is was so spongey it would pull the cheese from all the other slices. I literally had to use some sauce i had in my fridge to add some source of moisture to the pizza, which didn't help the flavor at all. My boyfriend is an advocate for this place but I've got to say i am not at all impressed. 
He enjoyed his wings, but also told me they are nothing like he remembered. Not enough buffalo sauce in the mix. But he is still okay with what he got in that aspect. We both agree the pizza was sub par.

Mini pizzas: AMAZING!!! They are hand tossed and made fresh EVERY day! The dough was light and perfect! And it was perfectly cheesy also!

The American Psycho Sandwich was labeled as a favorite on their menu so I decided to try it out. It has bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado, jalapeños and turkey. Absolutely delicious! Most turkey sandwiches pretty bland anywhere else but this one was packed with flavor! Would def order it again! 

The Jack burger was also labeled as a favorite and spicy. It was so scrumptious that we forgot to take a photo of it! You have to order the drinks separately but they're fountain drinks so you can get refills. 

Staff: The manager, Rebecca was very welcoming and friendly! She came over to our table and asked if we needed anything.

We'd definitely stick to the pizza alone for next time.

The patio was really cold the day we went and although we asked for the heater to be turned on as soon as we arrived, we ended up waiting close to 15 minutes for someone to turn one on. We were literally trembling from the cold & had we not been starving and craving some deep dish, we would've left. Instead we went back to the car and got some camping blankets we thankfully had. In the end, a family that was sitting in a sunnier area left and we ran and got that table because we still hadn't been helped and the heater was still off. It was a busy day but it took all of 2 minutes to turn them on. We were told that the problem was that only 1 of the 4 staff members knew how to turn it on.

At Pizza Luna, we ordered a 12"" pie with half pepperoni and half mushroom and extra cheese. The crust was thin and crispy on the outside, yet soft and baked well on the inside; basically wood-fired to perfection. It had just the right amount of tangy tomato sauce. The meat, cheese, and vegetables were so fresh and cooked to perfection. 

The front-of-the-house staff was remarkably friendly, engaging, and genuinely cared about safety. Everybody was wearing a mask!  The place was clean as a whistle.  The cherry, though, they were playing excellent music in the lobby (P.O.D, Saliva, Slipknot)! 

Please, please everybody, go to Pizza Luna. They have a stellar crew and they make a beautiful pie.  Thank you all, Tucson is a better community because you are responsible, honest, and humble business owners with a caring staff. Cheers!

On 6/27/20 we went to NYPD up the road and left the place because line staff (cooks, prep, etc.) were not wearing masks.

Quality/Quantity -
Psycho Cheesesteaks - Good flavor, but the potato salad was so small that I would have preferred nothing... See picture.
Build Your Own Burger 1/4 lb - Taste was good, but I did not feel the bread and lettuce was proportional to the meat and cheese, it was just off a little. Also, the chip bag is the mini size for little kids.

Atmosphere - Cool spot. I always enjoy craft breweries and good food concepts.

Service - Good.
Price - $17.39; reasonably priced except the size of the potato salad was embarrassing...

The pizza dough is crazy good and everything tasted fresh.  We ordered smalls of the Neopolitan, Traditional, Sausage Bianca, and the Fig, Pig and Goat so we could all sample as this was our first time ordering.  My favorites were the Fig, Pig and Goat (definitely a pizza you savor!) with its contrasting flavors and textures as well as the Traditional.

Ordering online was super easy and straight forward although when I ordered for pickup ""ASAP"" the confirmation email had the pick up time as 15 minutes later.  I highly doubted it would be ready in that amount of time and my husband went there about 20 min after ordering and the place was super busy and the wait was at least 40 min from ordering.  Wish there was a way for the restaurant to relay more accurate pick up times, but probably next to impossible for an automated system to do so.

The main reason for less than 5 stars is that the Radicchio Caesar Salad had huge pieces of lettuce that would be more convenient to eat if presented in more manageable pieces.

I went on a Wednesday night with my sister in law and we started with the San Remo cocktail. It's a Limoncello based drink and completely refreshing and delicious. They make the Limoncello in house. We chatted with the owner for a bit about recommendations. His descriptions of the dishes and how they are made were fascinating and helped us settle on the Fried Calamari and Meatball Parmigiana appetizers followed by Spaghetti Carbonara and Eggplant Parmigiana. 

The calamari was dee-lish! The breading was perfectly seasoned and the homemade lemon aioli was the perfect dipping sauce to add acidic balance to the savory calamari. 

One of the standouts of the night was the flavor of Bacio's marinara sauce. It rivaled my own Italian mama's sauce! If you are from the East coast you know this is a big deal! I wanted a bowl of the marinara to just eat with a spoon! The Meatball appetizer came bathed in this ridiculous marinara. The meatballs were huge, perfectly cooked and so so moist. I would recommend these all day long. 

I definitely over indulged on appetizers but when I tasted my Spaghetti Carbonara I decided it was absolutely necessary to undo my top button and power through! Bacio's Carbonara is incredible. The pasta is perfectly al dente and the balance of salty, smoky, and savory makes this the best Carbonara I have ever had, hand's down. (p.s. I've eaten a lot of carbonara). I highly recommend this dish too. 

My sister in law ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana. She loved it. I tasted it and loved it too. The owner explained that there is a three part cooking method to getting the eggplant almost caramelized and perfectly cooked while retaining that crispiness of the breading that we all love. And again, it comes bathed in their magical marinara. It was cheesy, crispy, and scrumptious. 

After all of this... yes, we ordered dessert. We shared a giant piece of Tiramisu. The best I've had in Tucson. 

Overall the meal did not miss a beat. Everything was perfect. Bacio has a great vibe. The service was attentive and friendly. It felt really homey having the owner checking in with all of the tables and chatting with the diners. Parking is never fun by the U of A, but this place is absolutely worth the effort. Next time...

I am a born and bred New Yorker and went there with high expectations. When you walk in, you are treated in a warm and friendly manner, the guy at the register was sincere and helpful. I ordered a Ceasar Salad and a regular Neapolitan pizza.  The salad came first while the pizza was cooking. It looked gorgeous. The lettuce was extremely fresh, sprinkled with grated cheese. Unfortunately, this was a case looking great, taste - eh! It was not bad, it just did not taste like much of anything. The dressing was totally bland and tasteless. I was not looking for the traditional heavy Ceasar dressing, but this just missed the mark. Then the pizza came. Again, looked great. I will say the crust was sublime. It is different than NY crust but excellent. That being said, three things make a pizza, crust, cheese quality, and THE SAUCE. The sauce on Pizza Luna's Neapolitan is made with ""San Marzano Tomatoes, Fior di Latte (homemade mozzarella), Chopped Garlic & EVOO."" Sounds heavenly, perfect ingredients. The results - the sauce is really disappointing. San Marzano Tomatoes form a light sauce with delicate flavor to be sure, but the results here were really disappointing -  bland, no depth, flavorless, but doused with lots of garlic. I am the type of person that if a recipe says to put in 2 cloves, I put in 4. A true garlic lover! The garlic here was overpowering and you will be tasting it for hours. The sauce needs some herbs, salt, pepper, and a touch of sweetness, something to take it up a few notches. This review is exclusively about the Ceasar salad and Neapolitan pizza. The crust was good enough to entice me to return to try with regular and specialty pizzas, like the fig, pig, and goat pizza that sounds awesome.",11-09-2021 00:41,0

That had to have tainted my perception of the place because it's so close to home  and we seem to get stuck in our rut of going to the same places. Now that I have been a couple of times I chided myself for not having a more open mind.

Why - because the pizza is really good. You get that char you can only get from a wood fired oven. Don't be scared off by the deep char it leaves on the outer crust - pure wood-fired flavor. The wings too were better than I ever thought they would be. Food came out and it was hot and fresh... you can tell I am delinquent in writing this review because, at this time, there is no visiting a restaurant.

We saw some other stuff on the menu that piqued our interest. That and the fact that Lindy (of Lindy's legendary burgers) is now in the fold I can't wait for all this COVID-19 stuff to pass so we can visit again soon. Maybe we will have to try takeout in the meantime, but I get the feeling the food coming straight from the kitchen or out of the wood-fired oven fresh to your table wouldn't be the same if it was stuffed in a box or container.",04-10-2020 00:50,1

That unending bond that through all the twists and turns, you will always be together. Unfortunately for us, that's the bond that the city of Tucson shares with street construction. They just won't break-up. While I know it is working toward the better of our streets, it can be tough on businesses having to deal with it. And if you haven't driven mid-town Broadway lately, it's ""tore up from the floor up"". 

I know it's natural to want to avoid that mess at all costs, but do you know all that you'd be missing out on? Do you? Well, I'll tell you...Rocco's. That's reason enough.

I reviewed Rocco's Little Chicago 5+ years ago but thought I'd come back to it. Since that review, I've lived in 3 different countries, eaten cuisine on several different continents, and survived the great toilet paper crisis of 2020, and my view still stands unchanged through the years. Rocco's serves the best hot wings you can find. Periodt. (I believe that how the youth says it these days?) I'm a big hot wings fan and actively search out the best and haven't found better in Tucson. Crispy. Tender. Saucey. Hot flavor actually has a spicy kick to it. Served with love and care and ranch or blue cheese. Hot wing heaven.

But wait, there's more! How does pizza sound? Thin crust? Deep dish? Stuffed like pie? Sure! Rocco's doesn't discriminate pizza styles. All is equal and cheesy.

There's also sandwiches, salads, pasta, beer, wine, cookies, cannolis. See all the goodness you'd miss out on because some cones are in the street. It's almost unfair.

Dealing with construction can suck, both for drivers and businesses. Let's beat it together. Eat a pizza. Drink a beer. (Leave the gun) Take the cannoli. Support Broadway business. Vote Rocco's 2020.",10-04-2020 06:14,1

Although the food is good and i will give the chefs that, my experience leaves me having a really hard time returning to this establishment.  As me and my two friends walked into Bacio this evening we asked to be seated outside and immediately were told by the owner ""No!"" no explanation and certainly no filter.  It was so blunt and rude I originally thought he was kidding.  We had just walked by multiple open tables outside before we entered.  I had heard rumors about staff by people I knew that worked for this man previously and that the owner has a hard time keeping employees, which i saw by no surprise.  There were multiple times over the course of my dinner that i heard the owner yelling at his staff, making them nervous and uncomfortable as well as representing horrible customer service as he would proceed to come over and talk shit on how bad of employees they are!!  So unprofessional.  Before my party and I were able to even order a young couple walks in and the owner immediately sits them at an outside table, one in which we were denied no more than 15 minutes prior.  Not sure if this is because we are young women or what but given that other parties were seated on the patio prior to us arriving this really hit a nerve.  If you are going to maintain a restaurant on a college campus, treat the students with respect.  I watched this man abuse his power the whole evening.  The owner was short, blunt, and just rude to both customers and staff, it not only made me feel awful for them but the owner continued to come to our table to talk shit about the staff and their laziness.  And let me tell you from what is seemed as a customer perspective they were working hard.  One of the women i was dining with expressed to him that she was upset an outside table was given to someone else minutes after us as we were denied a table outside and sat inside.  The owner was apologetic and even offered us gelato on the house which we were very appreciative of.  It was clear he knew he messed up and was feeling guilty.. or covering his ass, but there was still no remorse.  He told us he didn't have time for us to choose our flavors and that we had to hurry up because we were wasting time.  I have truly never experienced anything like this.  Overall, I am disappointed.  I had been to Bacio once before and thought the owner was rude and a bit odd but after this encounter I will not be returning in the future.

You can get really good pizza anywhere but most places don't have an amazing crust, fresh mozzarella and drum roll please! SAN MARZANO TOMATOES! 

We were here for a few days so I was on a search to find the best pizza I could find.. I found some places closer but I kept going back to pizza luna's Yelp page because nobody had this pizza. They may have looked like it but a true Neapolitan pizza does not have pizza sauce as other places were trying to sell..they use San marzano tomato's! So my decision was easy..yesterday I came in for just their slices to try..ordered the margherita (only difference was basil), their cheese pizza with pizza sauce as usual and their Neapolitan. Margherita was super good..not too different than the Neapolitan ..but my suggestion would be ..not to cook the basil..leave it fresh on top torn into pieces...still super good but the Neapolitan just seemed tastier to me..today with the large size I came back for I felt there wasn't any garlic like I tasted yesterday but that was the only bummer..and the cheese pizza was good..not the best I had but good..come here and try the San marzano pizza's..maybe even get some fresh arugula on it..wish I would have tried the bianca pizza..

Now for the customer service..these guys are all sooooo nice! They are friendly, polite and accommodating as I had some requests fir our long drive. They gave me a smaller box too so we don't have to keep the huge box in our car with us for our 7hr drive back home with a dog. Next time I'm in Tucson..I will be back!

My boyfriend and I walked in on a Thursday night before a UA basketball game, figuring it would be busy, but we were sat right away and there were only about five other tables seated. We'd walked up, unsure of where to stand to be seated, and waited a minute or so before someone in the kitchen yelled out, ""Have you been helped?"" and then someone came up to seat us. 
Our server was friendly and helped us decide what to order after we let her know we only had about 45 minutes before we needed to head to the game.
This is where it gets disappointing. She brought us the waters we asked for, which were served very warm with no ice, plus an unpleasant chemically flavor. I expect warm water in Europe, but in Tucson? Not typical nor pleasant. We asked our server for a cup of ice, which she brought a few minutes later, and that helped the situation. 
We each ordered a drink, the Porch Sipper and the Moscow mule. The drinks were fine -- nothing special for $7 and $8 each, but they were tasty and preferable to the water. 
We started with the fried mozzarella bites. The portion is generous and the marinara dipping sauce is pretty flavorful, but the bites were really soggy and not crispy at all. The fried coating fell apart when I picked them up and took a bite. The flavor was nice and garlicky, and the mozzarella tasted good, albeit maybe a little too salty (which means something coming from me, a salt fiend). But they just weren't crispy. It was just like eating a ball of mozzarella with some coating on the outside. No crunch whatsoever. They tasted good, but I wouldn't call them fried. 
We also ordered the Bologna pizza, which comes with red sauce, mozzarella and meatball. It was so, so cheesy, which might sound like a good thing, but it's not. I couldn't even taste the sauce. And when I went to take a slice and put it on my plate, half the cheese slid off. The abundance of mozzarella made it so we had to eat the slices with a fork and knife; it didn't hold its own at all. Also, the crust was bland. The meatballs and mozzarella both had good flavor, but the pizza itself was very poorly executed. 
We each only ate one slice because it was so heavy with all the cheese. We asked our server if we could take it to-go, and she brought out one regular square styrofoam box... for four slices of pizza. I'm not sure if she expected us to stack them on top of each other and have them stick together due to all that cheese? Why not a pizza box? It was very strange, and we had to wait until she came back around to ask for an additional styrofoam box for the rest of the slices. 
We noticed as we were putting the slices in the to-go box how unevenly the pizza was cut (see photos). Two of the slices were double the size of the rest. My boyfriend used to work at a pizza place on 4th Ave., and he said that type of poor cutting would've never flown there -- it would've needed to be recut or remade.
The total came to about $40 for two cocktails, the mozzarella app and a pizza. This would be a pretty good deal if the food were better. 
I would consider coming back to try the gelato or gelato cocktails, which seem fun and different. But I don't plan to try the food again.",03-07-2020 00:37,0

We don't know Tucson well (we're passing through), but from our experience this location was clean, had friendly/efficient employees, and has a pretty nice interior. All in all, it was a tasty and not-expensive dinner (about $80 for 7 MOD-size pizzas and 6 drinks, including tax -- we had a group of 8), so we left happy with our decision to go there. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because both employees making pizzas would have a latex glove on their hand, and then just grab each ingredient with the same gloved hand. So the hand goes into the chopped garlic, then it goes into the cheese (leaving some garlic in the cheese, then the veggies and then even the meat; or possibly vice versa. All the meat is cooked, so I'm not worried about cross contamination from a health standpoint. But it seems odd to mix ingredients like that, especially if anyone is vegetarian or vegan and may mistakenly get a small piece of meat or cheese that made it into  the veggie containers. I'd suggest utensils, at least for the meat and the garlic (which is in garlic liquid so it's more susceptible to being left behind in the next container).",8/20/2021 14:55,1

She basically said it was my fault and that that's the price of medium pizzas and that what I got. When clearly on line it says CARRY OUTS LARGES ARE $7.99! Instead of making things right she just wanted to argue over the phone. So after wasting an hour in total and not getting her to make me a large I asked for my money back. All she said after that was that she wanted her pizzas back. She send out a co worker to give me the money. I felt so bad for him and he apologized for his managers unprofessionalism!

Giving this place 4 stars because food was great but the cashier taking our order had a horrible attitude/customer service. 

Customer service: We were the only customers there at the time and were not greeted at all by the staff. I forgot my glasses so I had to take time viewing the menu. A female staff member finally came by after standing there for a few minutes and the first thing she says (very shortly) was ""be right with you"". We weren't ready to order yet because there were so many items to choose from and we were debating on getting a meatball sub or slice of pizza. The female staff member was standing at the register at this point and was rolling her eyes at us and answering us as if we were annoying her every time we asked a question about an item on their menu. So at this point, I was frustrated and just ordered 3 pizzas by the slice. When another customer came, she was completely nice to them. 

Environment: dining area was clean. Staff wore masks. 

Food: the single slice pizzas are HUGE! Literally one slice is equivalent to 2 (full) or 3 (thin sliced) pizzas. They have a single slice cheese pizza special with a 20oz drink for $7.50! Definitely worth it. You have the option to add toppings for an extra charge.

After moving to the west side my husband, brother, and I decided to make the 45 minute drive across town to come to our favorite pizza place. Unfortunately we had probably the worst service I have probably ever had at a bar or restaurant. First off, right when we walked in we felt unwelcome. While other people, which I'm assuming are regulars, got greeted warmly and immediately, we got the once over and were immediately asked if we were 21. We all ordered some pizza, appetizers, and a couple beers. The beer I got was not good and tasted syrupy, so after I took a sip I politely asked to have the beer replaced with something else. The server/bartender immediately said that since she poured it and I took a sip that I would still have to pay for this bad beer. My husband and I were like.... thats a strange policy to have. She became pretty argumentative, stating that every bar has that policy and if they gave everyone who didn't like their beer a new beer for free people would just do it all the time. What?! So I'm gonna take one sip of a beer, ask for a new free one, and repeat this one sip process over and over? Right... So then she asked the manager if I could have a new beer for no cost, came back with my new beer and said, ""Just so you know, I was able to take that beer off your check, just this one time."" and she continued to go on and argue with my husband about how they just lost $7 (which we all know a beer does not cost the restaurant $7 off the tap). I told my husband just to stop because we were obviously not getting anywhere with this conversation, and we ate our food feeling pretty uncomfortable for the remainder of the visit. When we were done, we paid and left without anyone saying any sort of goodbye. I have worked in the food industry my whole life and have never heard of any bar or restaurant that forces custimers to pay for drinks or food that they don't like, and also try to make them feel bad about it.

Needless to say, we will not be returning again and will also not be referring our friends anymore. We spent about $70 at this establishment and they lost our business and our referrals over a $1.50 pour of beer.

Pizza, garlic knots and salad were great.  But with no marinara sauce and no dressing for the salad those oversites totally destroyed any enjoyment of food.  Have you ever eaten a salad dry???

I ordered a turkey avocado sandwich. First of all, the picture on the website is SO deceiving. I know, I know, most pics for most places look nothing like the real food item. But still...  Anyway, I asked for no mayo on the sandwich, add cheddar cheese and instead of sourdough, I asked for the jalapeno cheese bread. Guess what I got? A really messy sandwich with VERY little turkey, lots of mayo and no cheese all on sourdough bread. I could only eat part of my sandwich after scraping all the mayo off. Best part of that sandwich was the avocado. 

My husband ordered the Bacon Smokcheesy and it came out the way he ordered it - standard. However it was such a small, flat sandwich with just one piece of bacon on it that it too was a big disappointment. 

We also ordered a Cinnabon cinnamon roll to take home. Surely that will be good, right? I've always been a fan of Cinnabon but this cinnamon roll was dry despite following the directions in the box to heat it. What a waste.

You know, I should have gone back inside from the patio where we were eating to complain about the food but a sudden power outage/surge in the area created some chaos inside of Schlotzsky's. Their menu boards went down which I would assume meant that their registers went down as well. I am sure my concerns and disappointment would have been met with blank stares at that time.

Based on past experience, I asked if everything was there.  The girl said, ""yes"".  I knew there was no way everything could be in there.  So I asked again.  Again, she said, ""yes""

When we got outside the door I decided to check.  Not surprisingly, I was missing a baked ziti AND the fried zucchini.

I waited outside on the patio with the food while my daughter went in to check on her order, too.  She said that instead of being contrite about it, the guy and girl were both rude.

Let me see if I have this correct.  YOU screwed up and YOU want to be rude about it??  They are lucky I didn't take their word for it and get all the way home and find out!  I would have really been cranky.  As it was, the zucchini tasted like it had been reheated and tasted lousy.

My latest and very last issue I'll be having with this place is ordering a pizza for carryout and it taking only 30 minutes to prepare and I was quoted 45 minutes. So according to the ticket my pizza sat there waiting for ME for 15 minutes. When I call to express my unsatisfaction that should have been guaranteed, I was told I'd be comped the pizza as I was too far away to bring it back and my kids too hungry to care what condition the pizza was in, sad but true. Besides I don't understand restaurants that want you to take the food back that they messed up in the first place so they can give you the right food that they should have gotten right in the first place. So now that's two inconveniences that I deal with. When I called the next night as I told the manager that I would, the manager said I only had a $10 off coupon to use on this next purchase, not another free pizza as she had promised the night before.  So why would I have to eat a shitty expensive pizza that I'm not satisfied with and then when I express my dissatisfaction and disappointment about the professionalism and quality of their product and services...im offered a discount on another product  instead of them trying  to prove to me that they aren't the shady mom and pop that has been around this community for years simply because they put their customers first and not their feelings.

There should be a separate reservation line. Once we got to our lane it was fun. Shoes were cute and clean. We shared our area with a dad and son. It wasn't too bad. I had to use the bathroom. It was filthy and smelled like putrid urine and rotten fish. It was so gross. Definitely need a lot of work in that area. We ordered drinks and fries. The soda was on the flat side and the ketchup pump hardly worked. I literally took 10 minutes pumping for 3 tiny containers. The last thing that was really bothersome was the videos they play.

I didn't expect much in the way of service, as this is an order-at-the-counter joint, but the cashier was nice and answered all our questions on the menu. We chose a 16-inch Gourmet Cheese. The pie was good. Cheese was perfectly gooey. The crust was a little thick but good, golden crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. 

While the pie is good, I think the place could probably use a deep cleaning, especially given we're in yet another rising COVID wave. A lot of the shakers of parmesan and peppers seemed grimey. There is a small room with arcade games that also probably haven't been cleaned in a while. I also found it to be a bit expensive for what it is. A 14-inch pizza was $28.10.

They finally called my name at 7pm...but only the wings were done. When asked about the pizza, staff questioned my request and proceeded to look through the trash for a ticket. At 7:14pm, my pizza was ready. I asked for cheese, peppers and ranch. The young kid said ""ranch is extra"". I had already lost my cool because I was hungry and annoyed, so i said ""you just made me wait 45 minutes for a pizza and you want to charge me for ranch???"" Also, becau
se a bit of crust tore off, they made an extra slice to make up for it. Instead of asking me what I may want, they chose to make another slice... 12 extra minutes! My friend went up to get me ranch because I was pissed off at these kids. He said the kids were back there laughing at me! The cashier started to ring up ranch dressing and my friend said ""I'm not paying for that. You charge me for that and we'll send the pizza back for a refund."" Slow, unprofessional service being run by teens on a Friday night with roughly 10 tickets up! I was very disappointed as I try to support local.

Enter the order and gave them 25 minutes to get it prepared. When I picked it up the order was totally wrong as I found out when I got home. I ordered traditional wings and instead got boneless wings. In addition I also included 10 Cinnabon I figured I would have for breakfast the following day and did not receive that. To add insult to injury I tried to call to resolve the issue. I made three separate calls. The first one I was on terminal hold for 12 minutes the second two I got disconnected after 10 and five minutes respectively. To add insult to injury I had included a 20% tip which certainly they did not deserve.

Mod had a special for free delivery on weekends with an order of $15+. We ordered online.  My son has food allergies so we took advantage of the deal when I wanted to get a much needed break from the kitchen. Delivery was fairly quick, the pizza did arrive cold(we just warmed it up) I'm sure they're swamped on weekends. They ask you to leave specific directions of where to leave the food, ring the doorbell, etc when you place the order. The delivery driver was not wearing a mask nor gloves. Which is probably another good reason to have no contact delivery. He followed the directions we typed in the box and the only notable difference on the pizza was the smaller amount of toppings they put on as well as then being out of shrooms. It was still worth the price and we were happy to be able to get free no contact delivery. I would recommend they provide their drivers with masks and gloves to keep everyone safe.

We spoke on the phone the next day, and he was kind enough to explain the circumstances around the recent changes, which was completely understandable. Several team members are going through training, and we are receiving two free meal deals to compensate for the recent experiences. I appreciated the direct contact, accessibility to the owner and the recognition of the loyalty we've had for Grandma Tony's over the years. Mr. Terry had several actions they had taken place from the night of the review through the next morning before our call, which included employee training on the computer system, the oven to prevent the crust from burning, and had great things to say about the team members that were learning their new roles. Great to see that there really is continued commitment to great customer service and the best pizza in town. Hopeful for continued great experiences moving forward, and grateful again for the customer appreciation.



Have been going to this location one to two times a week for several years. I've always had great experiences until recently. This past week (14th and 16th) the pizzas were overcooked, and we struggled both times with pricing. We ordered so much, that it was common to just say order what we had last time. It's never been an issue. I gave the 14th a pass because of Valentines day, however, when I got to the broadway location on the 16th, I had to explain to the cashier the x large 3 topping special, which was located on a black plaque in the entryway. The price is 13.99, and I was being charged over $19. She went to get what I believed to be the new manager, Maria, and Maria had explained to me because I had cheese on the pizza, that also counted as a topping, and was charged an extra dollar. What we ordered was the xtra large three topping special, one half sausage, mushroom, onion (the three toppings, the other half just the regular cheese topping), so instead ordering three toppings on the whole pizza, just half of it. She replied no, if I have cheese it's a dollar more... to which I smartly replied, so your three topping special is really just two toppings if I want cheese on the pizza.. and she said yes. I told her I've never had this much trouble here, and she said it's under new management. Incredibly disappointing, because we've always been treated respectfully, and had great pizza. At the end of the transaction, which I still think I grossly over paid, I opened the pizza box (they always did that for me to make sure I was satisfied), and saw the rock hard thin crust. This was the second time in a few days. She said ""You look disappointed"", I said yes, the crust is burned.. no response there. I felt she was very rude, didn't care about any level of customer service, quality of the pizza, and didn't try to be empathetic to the fact that long time loyal customers have been used to a process to which has changed with no explanation. We will give the Wrightstown location a shot, where we had also had great experiences. If that has also gone down the drain in service and quality, we will no longer be going to Grandma Tony's.

I had a late lunch at Mod yesterday, 07/22/20. It was around 1:30 pm. The restaurant was pretty busy. There were a couple of people in line ahead of me but I was able to wait inside on the floor markers that keep people distanced. It is over 100 degrees here in Tucson so AC and dine-in is important. I did notice some brave people eating on the patio. Ordering is a little nerve racking because the employees are shoulder to shoulder making pizzas and salads and then other employees are also behind the counter. It is hard for people to stand 6ft from a person making your food when they are asking how you want it made. They are asking customers to wear masks so communication is hard for some. Employees are also wearing masks but I did see someone with their nose uncovered making food. 
Paying, you have to touch the card reader and the attached pen attachment. There wasn't hand sanitizer near the register. I had to circle all the way back to the front door, where I came in, to get some. 
Drinks are still self-serve and it seemed to be an issue. They give you and empty cup and send you to a public drink station. They have a sign up that says ask for a second cup if you want a refill. The drinks are also next to the trash. I saw tons of customers crowded around the drinks and trash area. There wasn't any hand sanitizer nearby and people were refilling used cups. I even saw customers getting drinks without masks (required to come in I think). I also saw at least two customers pick up their food without wearing a mask, guess they just left it at their table. 
I probably won't be back during the COVID outbreak. Compared to some people, I have been eating out a lot, multiple times a week. Unfortunately, Mod has been one of the more uncomfortable experiences. I say unfortunately because I do really like their pizza and salads.",9/23/2020 2:42,1

I regret placing the order at the end of the night but Mama's was one of the few places open. The food took almost an hour before it was ready by the time we got it home it was almost 10:30pm. I had ordered a gluten free crust I ate couple of bites and thought the pizza was really bland. I tried another slice and realized there was no pizza sauce or so little it was undetectable. I thought maybe it was because it was gluten free. I asked my son how his pizza was and he said there's no sauce. He lifted the cheese on a couple of slices and sure enough no sauce or so little sauce you couldn't see it. His pizza was regular crust Neapolitan.

I called the manager today and told her all this and she said she actually made the pizzas the night before and followed protocol. She also explained that couldn't give a remake without seeing the pizzas! I didn't even ask for one and how could we have brought them back so late? She was as unpleasant on the phone as she was the night before (which I understood because of the lateness).

2kB-yEsErRlnhk3Nd_1voA,6O5Ud2Ik2S33YSZ5qV3t7Q,IujwicxDML3FMfHURhkojA,1,7,3,0,"We had a questionable experience at the Arizona Pizza Company (APC) last night. When we asked to speak with the manager, a very rude guy showed-up, informed us he didn't have time to listen to our concerns, and threw $2.50 on our table as compensation for the problem we experienced. His behavior is what now prompts this public review. Since the APC management didn't have two minutes last night to listen to our concerns, maybe he / they will find the time to read our concerns on one or all of the multiple internet review sites on which we will now be posting.

First some background: I began going to the Arizona Pizza Company sometime around 2012. Over the past 8+ years, I have watched the food and service at this over-priced and dirty restaurant steadily decline in the quality of their food and service (see the number of their one-star reviews on this and other review sites). The one thing that has been consistent has been APC's repeated attempts to cheat its customers. Given such dishonest behavior, the ONLY reason I had continued to return was because of one bartender who had become a friend.

About 3 or 4 years ago, I wrote a very critical review of the APC when I caught a female bartender pouring well whisky for me when I had been ordering and was being charged for premium spirits. I had been watching her closely make my drinks because that which she was serving to me just didn't taste right. When I confronted her, she denied doing that which I had just watched her doing with my own eyes. At the time of that writing, I wrote and swore I would never go back to the APC. There are simply too many honest merchants out there for me to continue to patronize a dishonest one.

As with most things, time heals all wounds and we recently began returning to the APC, again to visit with our bartender friend.  During last night's visit, I ordered a Double Jack Sour. A new female bartender charged me $5.50 for each shot of Jack Daniels and an additional $2.50 for Triple Sec ($13.50 total for the one basic and simple drink in this hole-in-the-wall bar). When I questioned the Triple Sec charge, the bartender's response was the charge was for the sour mix. Seriously? I am 68 years-old and have NEVER seen ANY organization make a seperate charge for any (non-alcoholic) mixer in their drinks. Had I ordered a Jack and Coke, would they have made a separate charge for the Coke? What about Jack and Water? How much does a splash of water cost at the APC? This additional $2.50 charge is a fraudulent up-charge and is simply intended to cheat the customer out of additional funds.

When we asked to speak with the manager, his obvious disinterest was well illustrated as described above. This ""management"" individual is certainly NOT someone who had graduated from the Wharton Business School. In fact, I'd be willing to bet he has never even heard of it, because he clearly knows very little, if anything, about customer service or relations

Is business so bad and money so tight that the APC has to continuously find new ways to cheat their customers? Perhaps business wouldn't be so bad if the APC was more honest and didn't try to cheat its customers in the first place. Unfortunately, I do not think the APC has even thought to consider that possible pathway to greater prosperity.... 

I would advise every reader to avoid this deteriorating pizza house. Again, there are simply too many honest merchants out there for any of us to continue to support a dishonest one. However, if you do decide to go, take heed: Look-over your tab and watch your female bartenders VERY closely. If you don't, you will probably pay more than you should.",12/19/2020 20:01,0

Waited 30mins outside for an order that was deemed ready on their tracker. Finally had to go bang on the door to get someone to do their job. Why offer curbside pickup if you don't actually care to do it?",10-04-2020 02:03,0

This is my husband and mines 1st time at MOD and sad to say this will be our last.
The lady who took our order didn't have her hair pulled up in a bun. Her ponytail was swing around. Come to find out she was the manager.
While ordering we asked more then 6 times for cheesy garlic bread. There was no one around  but they refused to listen to our request. After getting a little upset they finally told us they were sorry that they ran out of dough but they didn't they made 4 more pizzas  before they ran out. 
We were paying for our meal we asked for a No Name Cake and 2 drinks. The cashier repeated out orders
twice and then we asked about our cheesy bread and she looked shocked .  And asked if they have started the cheesy bread and the manger said no not yet! And by this time it has been over 8 mins our pizzas have already been placed in the oven. And when we asked about our drinks the cashier and tells us that we didn't order any drinks but it's like you repeated our order twice and said 2 drinks both times.
After the cashier finished ringing up 3 other customers we asked her for the manger. 
My husband and I were just asking her why are bread sticks weren't not going to come out with food and about the drink issue we were not trying to get anything for free. Instead of her apologizing she handed us 2 cups and said BETTER!! and walked away.

My birthday was September 21, 2020 and the one thing I told my boyfriend I wanted to do for my birthday was to go bowling seeing as how it has been over a year since we last went. The only problem was, we had to decide on a different bowling alley to go to because the one we usually would go to, Golden Pin Lanes, closed on June 21, 2019. 

One good thing, I guess you could say, or so we thought, is we recently moved and where we moved is walking distance from Lucky Strike so of course, using common sense, we decided to go to Lucky Strike for my birthday. But after that night, I will NEVER and I mean NEVER go back to that bowling alley again, even if it was the last bowling alley on the planet.   

With that said, yes I would of much rather give this company and zero star review but Yelp makes you choose at least one so I choose one and please tell me if I am being a bit over dramatic but I promise I will not exaggerate anything. 

So we arrive at Lucky Strike. We walk in and go to the counter. The Employee walked up and aske how he could help. We old him we wanted to bowl two games for each of us. It came out to $32.00, like wtf over charged. Especially because I called earlier that day and they said it is $4 per game per person so if you add that up, two games for two people: 4+4+4+4= $16 so that means $16 in taxes, I think not. 

The employee advised us we were on lane 5. We grabbed our shoes and went to order some food. Once we were done with that we went to our lane to get our shoes. When we went to go look for a bowling ball to use we couldn't find any until one of the employees informed us that they had all the bowling balls and they had to hand us one. I understand because of COVID but come on really?? 

The employee who was handing out the bowling balls looked like he was on some sort of drug. The way his eyes looked, his face, just everything about him was weird and said drug all over it. And I know I definitely would not want my kids seeing that. 

And I don't know about you, but anyone who is serious about bowling knows that using a house ball is different. The cracks and grooves in them can make it go different ways. Well I was bowling pretty bad because the holes for my fingers were to big so I went back to the front and asked them if I can get another ball and preferably one with smaller finger holes. They told me they didn't have any and then tried handing me a lower weight ball so I asked if it was the same weight and they said no so they tried handing me the ball that I just gave back to them. And then argued with me about it. Sorry but for a company who is ""family friendly' and ""customer oriented"" they don't act like it. Who argues with the customer? 

And once that entire situation happened that same employee kept giving me dirty looks for the rest of the night?? 

After that, my entire night was ruined. 

So unless you want to be argued with when you go to try to have fun especially with your kids (I know I don't want someone arguing with me in front of my kids) don't go there!!! Go have fun somewhere else or at another bowling alley because this bowling alley over charged and likes to argue with customers.",9/24/2020 6:30,0

Most recently, I ordered their you-pick-two combo with an orchard salad and tomato basil soup. The soup was pretty delicious with garlic bread on the side and a swirl of pesto sauce on the top. The salad was good in theory, but the greens were sparse and wilty. I also asked if they had a balsamic vinaigrette, and the cashier told me yes. But my food was delivered with no dressing at all, so I grabbed some oil and balsamic vinegar off the condiment bar. That's fine but not the same as a vinaigrette.

The restaurant was super busy around 1 p.m. The staff was pretty nice but seemed to be having trouble keeping up. Almost every table was dirty and we waited a while for our lunches, which were both soups and salads, and I'd think a lot of that is premade (i.e., nothing needing to be cooked.)

   When I got home and opened the box I could not distinguish the ingredients; The pizza looked like it had congealed into a blob.

And, I am sorry to say this, but it appears to me, that the pizza could have been microwaved.

Their delivery takes like an hour or more and the manager says the 'Pizza Tracker' isn't correct - even though it is dead on at every other Domino's.  (I LOVE the Pizza Tracker!)  Last time it said it had been delivered when it hadn't even left the store yet and it was already 45 minutes since our order.  We live less than a mile from the location.  So now, we don't wait hours for delivery.  The Tracker originally said it would be ready in 15-25 minutes and it was ready in 30, so close.  For some reason, Okiohicho (?) took a REALLY long time to Prep the Order.....over 20 minutes. 
Anyway, this particular order, the two pastas were in the wrong boxes/labeled incorrectly.  Since Mom can't see, Dad handed her mine and she started eating it.  When I opened 'mine', it was obviously wrong.  Luckily, we just switched, but she had already eaten most of the mushrooms.  I ordered a Brooklyn crust this time, for the first time.  It doesn't seem much different than hand tossed, which is fine, but the pizza was RIDICULOUSLY greasy.  The first piece showed the pizza had soaked the bottom of the box all the way around the pizza.  It's the same pizza I always get - pepperoni and bacon with white sauce, and the hand tossed and thin crust aren't greasy like this.  SO what happened?  Surely a CRUST isn't greasy?  I only had one piece, and I paper towel dried it, but it still gave me a stomach ache.  :(  The Cortaro location in Marana is a continual disappointment, every, single time.
Don't get me wrong, like other reviewers, the workers inside seem to be working their tails off, and the food is still pretty good.

Since we got takeout, I can't speak to the dine-in experience, but we were very pleased with how quickly our food was ready, and found the ordering and pickup experience very easy! 

We started with the Meatball Sliders -- one of my friend's favorites. The appetizer comes with three sliders, each of which features a large meatball with marinara sauce and cheese on a brioche bun. I liked the sliders; they were well-seasoned, rich, and definitely whetted our appetite. 

We followed that with the Local Beet and Goat Cheese Salad, which I'd absolutely get again! It was a salad of mixed greens, beets, goat cheese, jicama, green onions, and toasted walnuts, with a sherry mesquite honey
vinaigrette. I loved it! The salad was very generous in size, as well as with its featured ingredients: lots of beets and big chunks of goat cheese. The dressing was a great acidic counterpoint to the sweetness of the beets and the richness of the cheese. I'd use that salad dressing on everything! 

We also had the Tuscany pizza, which is topped with sausage, mozzarella, Kalamata olives, garlic, onions, fennel, portobello mushrooms, and fresh basil. This is a seriously good pizza. It's hearty and quite salty, so anyone looking for a light pizza should seek that elsewhere. If you're looking to indulge, though, this is a good one!",02-09-2021 00:19,1

Zona 78 is across town for me and my partner, and while it's not a place we would make a special trip for, it is good. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and, although we did not have a reservation, we were seated promptly. The space itself is clean with a nice, open feeling. The kitchen is open, which is something I appreciate. 

We noticed that they have an upcoming wine dinner that was sold out, and they do have an extensive wine list and a nice selection of beer.

The menu offers Italian-inspired appetizers, salads, pizza, and entrees. My partner selected the Idaho Rainbow Trout, and I selected the Cedar Plank Salmon. I was somewhat surprised that this restaurant doesn't offer bread/olive oil while you wait for your food. Perhaps they sell more appetizers that way or perhaps bread and pizza would be too many carbs. It was a bit of a wait for our entrees, but the person delivering them said they were the best on the menu.

My lightly-seasoned salmon was cooked just the way I requested it, and it was a perfect portion. The spaghetti squash and arugula complimented each other and the fish well. I enjoyed the blood orange drizzle as well. 

My partner's trout also was cooked well. The lemon butter was light, which is what he prefers, and the bacon added a nice flavor to the green beans and potatoes.

Our waiter stopped by once after we ordered to make sure that our food was OK. He also asked if we wanted dessert and left our finished plates sitting in front of us to go get our check when we said we did not.

I sampled a small amount and found it was high on salt and not very complex in taste otherwise.  Crust was great, and I've found bakery items to be generally good.  As someone who eats 90% plant-based, I was hard-pressed to find an option on the menu.  Ended up going with the hummus plate.  Many salads had cheese that could easily be fashioned without them, so perhaps that is a modifiable vegan option, but why not offer at least one truly vegan salad?  Much creativity could go into that, and I'd love to see that applied by the chef.  Would be great to see more options for people trying to be more sustainable and cruelty-free with their diets.

(side note: sometimes customer experience is below average, wait time above average, and answers to questions a bit pretentious/short as other reviews have mentioned, but I'm just happy to have anyone willing to show up to work during a pandemic and provide me food that I didn't have to make myself, so I'm not basing my review or rating very much on that.)",01-03-2022 01:43,0

And he was inattentive throughout the dining experience. Even the expeditor placed the plates incorrectly. He had a 50% chance of getting it right. Nope. I've been a waiter. I know what both men should be doing. If the restaurant is understaffed, add staff. The waiter should be yanked from front-line service. That was a 100% weak effort.

So I order a simple Caesar Salad. Impossible to mess up, right? Zona 78 should get no stars for the quality of this meal. It was exactly the same size as the side salad. The bowl/plate was lukewarm. That's unconscionable. Two or three passes over the grater in the prep area produced almost no cheese. The dressing was unremarkable and scant. No comment on my date's appetizer. She had it boxed.

We got the take-home special for 4-6 people of fettuccine alfredo, and we added chicken. I originally wanted to order because of their meatballs, but my husband's choice won. We ordered it with chicken. A full pan, a large salad, and bread sticks all for $50. I threw in an order of meatballs to try the day after (extra $4). Just tried them and they weren't anything special, unfortunately. I'm picky about my Italian food though.  **If you check in on FB, you get a free large drink. 

To be honest, all my friends raved about the food. I liked it, but I found it a bit bland. I liked the portions, but I wish it had more flavor. The chicken was a bit overdone, as well, and the bread was soaked. I think tomorrow's leftovers will be delicious with the bread crisped up in the air fryer and a bit of added salt and pepper on the pasta.

Ubet Eats gave me a $5 credit towards a future Uber Eats order. They did NOT give me the $16 refund the restaurant promised me.

It was unfit for human consumption. The pasta was undercooked and partially fused into a Gordian knot. The meat sauce covered only 1/3 of the pasta. The whole mess was cold. The garlic toast appeared to have been prepared one or more days previously.  It was dry and hard. The good news - it was not a full order. The container was only about 3/4 full.

Oh...AND charcuterie.  DON'T forget the charcuterie.  Zona made Buffalo Mozz, Zona made Burratta, and their signature Zona made Fresh Mozz all make a grand entrance with Zona made (of course!) Pesto and Bruschetta crusts. You're served a beautiful cheese-fest followed by a meat-fest featuring Sopressatta, Copa, Finochietta, and the KING: Prociutto. Do yourself a favor and build your own bruschetta to go along with whatever glass of wine you love to get from Zona's happy hour. I ate so much but I could NOT stop the party until I tried every option. Being able to watch the meats sliced LIVE with a hand crank meat slicer was so much part of the experience making the wall between Chef and guest disappear. Chefs kept dropping off bruschetta like they couldn't wait to see the reaction once the taste buds got a hold.  Paulie (say it like an NYC Italian mob boss!) made his pasta as we sat and watched, and stuffed, and drank, and laughed, and savored. Having already spent time perfecting his own Zona made bread (you know the kind: crisp crusted with a soft center that made you want to hollow it out by the greedy handfuls! ) he spent the afternoon making pasta for that nights dinner special. 
Zona 78 does so much right. From the food to the service you're NOT going to get the experience anywhere else in town except maybe from your Nana's kitchen. That's Zona 78 to me: Nana's kitchen. She'll stuff you until you can't move (the flight of bruschetta coming at you and watching the chefs during the process).

I want to start by saying we have been going here since this location opened. I've raved about you guys to everyone since. We frequent often even though it's quite pricey for us (I spend no less than $70 but usually closer to $100 or more). Today we wanted to support one of our favorite local businesses. I placed an order as well as an order for my mom at 4:30, pickup time of 5 was given. We arrived at 4:55. The cashier told us that it was being finished and should be ready in a couple minutes. We stood near the back and waited. I could see the take out area from where I was at. First, it appears very disorganized and I watched the 2 girls opening and closing and reopening bags several times to see what was in it. After 25 mins waiting I finally walked up once again to ask how much longer. Turns out all of our hot stuff had been sitting there for a few minutes and they were waiting on a salad...really. A salad that took 2 mins to be produced. So our food sat there for at minimum 10 mins for a salad that was quickly done. I walked out with our food at 5:20. My moms salad had been sitting there waiting nearly the entire wait time. I was home within 5 mins of leaving and our food is luke warm. The salad I ordered tossed was not tossed. For a $72 order, you could have done better. I don't know what you can change in your process but it's clear something should be. Not once did anyone come up and let us know what was taking so long (probably because it was ready and just not being put together). I barely got a ""sorry for the wait"" when the food was handed to me. I don't know if this is an off night or what but it doesn't make me want to try again. I hope this reaches someone who cares. I know times are tough but feedback can be helpful.

I've always enjoyed Piazza Gavi. Their food is tasty and service generally good. But last night's take out experience was both disappointing and infuriating.

It was my wife's birthday and she chose to takeout from Piazza Gavi. We ordered 4 dishes and Piazza Gavi managed to mess up something on each: My wife's chicken parm is supposed to come with a side of pasta but PG forgot to include it. The Baked Mostaccioli Barese that I got is supposed to come with both sliced sausage and meatballs but they forgot the meatballs. The two spicy wedge salads we ordered are supposed to come with blue cheese dressing but they forgot to include any dressing. In the end, four dishes and four ""forgot to includes"". They did however remember to include the 15% service fee.

To summarize my frustrations:

I drive several miles to pick up a takeout order, they hand me a big bag, packed to the gills. No I don't unpack the contents while there. I trust them to get the order right. I get home and find multiple things missing from the order. Do I drive several miles back to the restaurant to complain and hope they make good? Not me. I just stew about it all night and write a review the next day.

PG tacks a 15% service fee on top of their already top dollar prices. I rationalize it as, okay this is a special occasion meal so I'm happy to pay the premium. At least I know I'm getting a quality product. But then you don't.

This was indeed a special occasion as we were celebrating my wife's birthday. I wanted everything to be perfect. What a huge disappointment! What can you do other than write an honest review to send a message to PG to do better by their clientele and to warn others of the sheer disregard PG has for them and for the quality of their product.",07-12-2020 22:04,0

We called to order the Two X-Large pizza deal. We were put on hold five times and they said they would let them know it was X-Large because they mentioned large. Then we got a call back stating that we were getting two larges and no answer as to why the flyer says otherwise. This is shady marketing and frankly a bit of a bait and switch. I am normally not one to write reviews, but this leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I personally will never order here again.

Update: we just got our pizzas as we were on the phone calling the store because it took well over an hour to get our pizza. While my partner was on the phone, he asked the manager or whoever was on the phone how quickly his tone changed when he asked to speak to the manager. Once he mentioned that, the person on the phone who said they were the manager claimed that the other person was their twin brother. We actually found out and verified that there is not a set of twin brothers that works at that location. So instead of actually acknowledging that he was wrong and that he did in fact have a tone with us, he decided to do the shady thing once again. A simple lie that could've easily been an apology and that would've made us happy. But at this point we are extremely angry and the manager there seems to think we are fools. All we wanted since the beginning of our business with blackjack pizza was to order a pizza based off the coupon flier they sent out. Instead all we got intern is one giant joke and I will continue to tell everybody I know not to go to this pizza shop ever.",12/14/2021 2:41,0

I am sure they do many things very well, but my dinner just plain sucked..

We started with Fried Calamari.  The breading was WAY too salty, it was cooked well, but almost inedible due to the amount of salt in the breading...

I then had the veal piccata with instead of pasta marinara opted for angle hair with Alfredo and my others guests opted for other items..They uncharged $7 for the Alfredo.

So our meals came.. my angle hair in Alfredo was disgusting... the sauce was way too thin. It tasted like bland white butter sauce.. I would have preferred sauce our of a jar to the crap they served me.. My veal piccata was way too salty, almost inedible with the veal overcooked and tough.

Piccata is a light delicate sauce and veal can toughen if over cooked, so what was served was terrible... For $30, I was served three pieces the were the size of silver dollars on a large plate swimming in salty sauce.

So maybe I was served a rushed dish, or cook had a cold or I went on an off night, or the moon was not out, or who knows what, but my meal was crap...

My boyfriend is the one who introduced me to this place (he works at the U of A) and raved about a place with the  B E S T  fried chicken sandwich, and this was it. Damn was he on point!

He told me my pizza is right there where he put. And his GPS is never wrong he had been doing this job for a long time. When I denied there being a pizza at my door he became belligerent and rude on the phone and accused me of lying. I am so disgusted.

We had take-out today.  We ordered over the phone, and service was courteous.  Food was promised ready in 15 minutes, and it was.

The actual food was a mixed bag.  We ordered a bolognese and a carbonara.  The Bolognese (mostaccioli pasta with a crema and meat sauce) was very tasty, and the overall portion is very large -- easily enough for two.  A winner.  It is my wife's favorite.  

Did I say my wife's favorite?  And so of course she ordered the Carbonara Italiana -- pancetta, egg, and parmesan cheese on angel hair pasta.  Simple, yet daunting to make at home, because if you add the egg when the pan is too hot, you get scrambled eggs and pasta, and not the lovely silky smooth, emulsified sauce that can only come from egg yolks lovingly combined with a bit of oil, pasta water, pancetta and cheese.

But, scrambled eggs and pasta is what we got, with a horrendous bitter aftertaste.  If we had been sitting in the restaurant, we would have sent it back. It was inedible.  

My thoughts?  Maybe carbonara doesn't travel well.  But geez, it was really bad.  It's a premium restaurant, with premium prices, and I think they could have done better.

If you like Bolognese, you're in luck.  It's always been good here.  Great, even.  If you really like carbonara, then I recommend you try someplace else.  I know we will.",08-10-2020 23:40,0

One of the first places I visited when moving here in 2016. Stunned at the sheer volume of people that attack the door to get in... mind boggling, really. 

This restaurant literally does Mediterranean/Italian with class and style. I dare you to find a comparable restaurant in Tucson with this much class! Every single time we come here, we leave satisfied. The diverse menu, organic to, pies to Calamari to Ahi-Ahi, you'll certainly have your choices. The restaurant is noisy but it's because everyone enjoys this place!

I can claim zero issues here looking across numerous eat-ins. This place just succeeds IMO and the sheer volume of people is a backing point to this. 

Come have a sit. Their wine and beer collection is wonderful and marries to all the foods presented here.

We finally decided on Frog & Firkin because everywhere else had a 45 minute to an 1 hour wait. We parked and went in and we were seated quick in the back which was very nice because we were STARVING. 

We all were ready to order and our waiter took our drink orders and asked us if we wanted apps and we ordered the apps but also informed him we all knew what we wanted to eat but he said he would come back for that. He brought our drinks with no straws(we ended up having to ask 3 times for him to acutally bring them by the end of dinner)  When I ordered my alcoholic beverage I had my card out and ready but he did not card me which is unprofessional. 

Almost 30 minutes later we still dont have our apps and habent ordered, and then a very obnoxious party came to play pool right next to us and we basically had to move out of the way for them to shoot everytime the ball was on the side closest to us.(this just added to our frustration.)

Around 45 minutes in we finally get our apps and get to order our entrees. The apps were VERY good. Kudos to that! 

Our entrees came out shortly after and we ordered 2 steak sandwiches both medium (one of them was well done) and they were both not seasoned at all. We had to actually salt them ourselves. I had the fish tacos which were dry. The 2 slices of pizza were okay. 

We asked for 4 sides of ranch (for the fries) and about 10 minutes later our waiter comes back asking how were doing and my fiance says were still waiting on the ranch. He asked if we need 1 or 2 and we again have to tell him 4. 

By this time we all knew we regretted coming to Frog In Firkin and wishes we would of waited the 45 minutes at Texas Roadhouse or Cheddars.

We ordered a pizza and some mozzarella sticks from Mama's for pick up last week.  I was just that desperate for pizza, and wanting to support the closest local restaurant to us.  We got there about five minutes before they said it was ready.  It was done promptly in their quoted time.

We live a mere five minutes away, and I was starving so I dug right in.  But...wait.  The cheese was all congealed and had a dull luster look to it.  Why?  Because it was ICE COLD.  They gave us a pizza they cooked probably many hours earlier and just had sitting around.  What a disgrace to serve to your community at times like these.  We had to put it back in the oven to resurrect it, and it was just as flavorless as I remembered Mama's being.  The mozzarella sticks were hot, at least.  Not the side sauce, though.

I will give them credit for being able to put the food into my car for a contactless pick up (which is why I generously gave them 2 stars vs 1 star).  But they wouldn't take payment over the phone so you're stuck using Eatstreet, who charges fees, if you want to go 100% contactless.  Silly.

He says ...what, It's 75 degrees out, if you need to you can sit inside. Turns his back and walks away and says sit wherever you want.  So we picked a table and after a few minutes I was still so annoyed by how rude he was we left.  Too many other choices in the area. So we went next door and spent our money!

Not sure if all the other locations have the same Interior theme like you're in the woods surrounded by trees and what not; it is a neat touch however very outdated and in desperate need of an update or a very deep clean for sure. I did have positive hopes for the food here because as simplistic as it looked when I yelped it I was hoping for the best (sometimes these are the joints that surprise you). I'll start with the good things, steak fries are what come with the combo platter and those are always a fav for me when places offer them, the combo platter itself was your normal frozen foods that get fried nothing too wowing there. The Stromboli was okay but I think more fillings inside would make it so much better (it's mostly dough in every bite).

On a Saturday after working on renovations all day, my husband and I were both craving subs.  We used a food delivery service due to being really tired.  We placed our order, along with specific requests (no onions, no peppers, sauce on the side, etc.).  We received our food within an hour, much faster than the advertised 75 - 90 minutes, so that was good.
First, the heroes are huge!!!  Much longer than 12"".  Our two orders of fries were combined into a single container (or so we think).  I ordered the combo hero, which was Italian meats and provolone and lettuce and tomato with Italian dressing.  My husband ordered the sausage parmigiana.
The fries were great!  Basically steak fries, and they travelled really well.  An ample container of ketchup was provided.
My hero unfortunately had the peppers and onions that I requested to be left off.  This sandwich was a monster (in a good way).  The bread was soft with a crusty exterior.  The meats and provolone were stacked beautifully.  I have more than 1/2 of it leftover for lunch.
My husband's sandwich was a bit of a mess.  The requested sauce on the side didn't happen, so the bread was so soggy that it had to be managed with a fork.  It also included onions and peppers, which were an unfortunate surprise, as that wasn't described in the menu.

A few had on gloves, but none had on masks. Nearly all customers did, but no one working there did. Your think for their own protection they'd take this some precaution.

Until we have evidence, we're not out of the woods. There are plenty of places following the recommended guidelines - we'll be going there until this all blows over.

The food took forever to come out so I just removed the black charred edges myself because I didn't want to wait for another one. It was way over cooked and only served with a small amount of aioli on the bottom bun. Other than that I was served a dry, plain burger with pickles on the side; no produce, no other condiments. My side salad was spring mix with what seemed like weird pre-chopped red onions that had no flavor. My guys sandwich was ok. The chicken is shredded and super spicy so definitely beware of that if spice isn't your thing. He loves spicy normally but still had a hard time eating it. Spring mix and feta were on top of the sandwich with more spring mix on the side. Spring mix is an interesting choice to put on a sandwich in my opinion. It needed lots of ranch to make it less dry. We both had an adult beverage and our bill was still less than $40 thankfully. This is a cute conveniently located place so hopefully they have something good on the menu. This trip though, we definitely didn't order it.",5/31/2021 14:38,0

The Margherita is fresh, flavorful and a joy to eat. You can tell the mozzarella is stretched fresh on site. Although I'm not a mushroom lover the Umami Tsunami is a flavor bomb that I couldn't get enough of. The mushrooms are pickled so they take on a totally different flavor. Also, the crust on these pies is so delicious that there's never an uneaten crust left behind. 
As for the pasta, I've had the fettuccini alfredorado which is Alfredo sauce blended with a red Colorado sauce. A warm taste, not overly spicy. A different delicious spin. The other one I tried is the arrabiata which caught my attention with its spicy flavor. Super. 
Don't forget the arancini. Love made of rice and corn, deep fried with a tasty sauce.

Not sure why the noodles were stuck so together seeing that it's supposed to be fresh. Maybe it's my fault but I thought there was supposed to be green chili in the sauce but the noodles were green chili flavored.

We also got their Zo Pizza which was supposed to be chorizo, chile Colorado and cheese. The pizza had no real character to it. The chorizo was not spicy at all. As a matter of fact it kind of tasted sweet. I could not really make out any chili colorado flavor.

The only thing that we did enjoy was their roasted broccoli. Garlic lemon and Parmesan just blended perfectly to make a taste that I've never had before. 

They are only open for delivery and take out which is odd because we did not get any napkins or plastic ware to eat. Luckily we carry our own.

Brought my kids there for their first visit to Tucson; this was our very first stop. We were harassed and essentially kicked out by the emotionally unstable manager. I am the first one to put my kids in line if they are mis-behaving, but they weren't. We were threatened from the moment we went to the back area after relocating from the front about ""not allowing  our kids to touch any of the glass, etc. because it costs $200 to clean it each time"".  If you haven't been to the back, the entire perimeter is a glass railing, not sure how you expect to enforce this so perhaps consider a different material next time as last time I checked railings in restaurants will inevitable get touched. There are drunk people dancing on the walls and tables (good for them!), yet you're worried about our kids not touching the glass? Coincidentally, they weren't touching any glass because they were busy playing bean bags with the bags that we checked out. Your servers were all apologizing to us for his aggressive, and frankly very threatening, behavior towards us.  The manager was scathing at us and making snide remarks about our kids playing bean bags to one of the bus boys, to which I asked him to calm down and please stop, which instigated his even more aggressive response. In the end, he told me I don't know how to parent my kids which is a point I will not tolerate (and seemingly ironic as I could bet the farm to say this man has non of his own). I work hard, and spend every last ounce of energy I have ensuring my kids have manners, respect, and values. As we left, the server apologized profusely to my 8 year old daughter for this man's behavior; she extended  her hand, shook his, and said thank you. Guess I need to work on my parenting skills.  The server told us the manager had also lashed out at another family with a baby (who'm couldn't even walk and was in there arms or stroller the whole time). Coincidentally, he was berating one of the female servers in the hall when we walked in before any of this happened (the first warning sign this man is a terror). This guy tried to get into a physical fight with my friend at the end of all of this. I am literally in shock by the behavior... I assume drug testing isn't a part of their hiring protocol.

I didn't see a sign saying no families who are about to drop $300+ dollars in an hour allowed. If kids aren't allowed (even well behaved ones), or families are going to be harassed for being there, maybe just put a sign up stating that so people don't waste their hard earned money and leave traumatized trying to explain to their children why terrible human beings exist in this world.  My two cents, the manager is a major liability.

The girl told me to call 15 minutes before we arrived and they would set up tables. I decided to arrive 15 minutes earlier than my guests instead.
I was extremely disappointed to find out there was no air conditioning and the building was stifling. Tucson was under an extreme heat advisory that day.
I came to find out the owners were going to be replacing the AC ""soon"".  It had been out for a while. They had no fans to move the air at all. I felt bad for the employees.
As my guests arrived we had to make the decision of whether or not we wanted to stay. We opted to leave. If there had been some air moving it would have been tolerable. But at 4:45 in the afternoon it was too hot to think about eating hot food in dead heat.
The staff could have told me about the AC not working when I called earlier in the morning but didn't for some strange reason.

The guy taking orders and another guy running delivery orders were the only two pleasant servers. Our food was brought to us and and I told our server that we still hadn't received our bruschetta. She then told us ""I know."" She offered us bread and walked away. We waited until we were halfway done with our food until I walked to the kitchen area (it's an open design so I was still in the restaurant) to ask if we would be getting our bruschetta. The kitchen did not know it had been missed. The other food runners were standing around talking and didn't say much. I told them which table we were and someone said it would be right out. After 30 minutes from order to table we received our bruschetta. I ate one piece because I was full from my meal. My boyfriend went to get to go boxes. The guy he asked for the box from was prompt and polite. While we had tipped after ordering, we attempted an additional tip to both him and the cashier but were told that the tips were communal. So they refused this additional tip. The food was good, but the service (sans the two individuals mentioned) was awful.

Appetizer Elote!  These things are amazing, so many flavors and textures.  We all loved it. 

The pizzas. We tried the margarita and a pepperoni pizza, but we really
Mediocre, no flavor in the sauce or toppings and the crust was floppy and not what we were expecting. Don't believe the hype this pizza is not good, you can get better pizza at Peter piper so save your $. 

Pastas:  we tried the fettuccine alfredorado and the wolf shrimp linguine. 

In my opinion. The cook in the back does not believe in salt and pepper or any seasonings or they don't taste the food they are service.  I had to get up and ask for salt pepper, ow how about some Parmesan cheese to add to it.  The pasta was fresh and homemade it seems but the bland flavor ruined our experience.  On a scale of 1-10 this place gets a 4.4 some items were good, but the failed on some others very badly.  Would we go back, no.

Not impressed about anything that happened.


Went here for a friends child's birthday today. I think the that bathrooms of an establishment reflect the care and attentiveness of the management and staff. 5 stalls had unusable toilets, one was out of order and the one I had to use had no toilet paper.

After that horrifying experience, there was ZERO soap in the dispensers. Think about that.

The layout of the restaurant is straight forward and open. The ordering is a bit different since you order at the front counter and pay for your meal and they bring it to your table once it is done. We ordered the following:

Elote Arancini - street corn + risotto, lime crema, Queso fresco

Green Chile Pappardelle and Peppe Marinara

Mushroom risotto - BKW Farms blue oyster mushrooms, portobellos, smoked poblanos, truffle zest, allium

The Elote Arancini comes out as little balls of deliciousness. Was definitely a good pick on that one.

The Green Chile Pappardelle and Peppe Marinara was savory with a small kick. Visually the green pasta covered with the white melted cheese and then coated with the rich red marinara was a very inviting dish. As a meal it was fantastic.

The risotto was.... addictive. Rich savory creamy and just everything you would expect a mushroom risotto to be. The serving portion was pretty large as well so do not expect to be eating this and leaving hungry still.

As a whole the food and service was fantastic, we are hoping this place sticks around for awhile. That location seems to have problems keeping businesses around.

BUT I will point out why I gave a three star review - Tucson is in the middle of a heat wave. When we went in it was 107 outside and inside it was pretty warm as well. Halfway through dinner I was using my napkin to wipe sweat off my brow. There was no A/C or swamp coolers running that we could detect.

So while the food and service was great, the place looked nice and the environment had a good feel to it the lack of cooling kinda put a damper on the enjoyment.

We will return when it is cooler.",6/19/2021 20:13,0

It has never been speedy service here. But we are ok with that. Today we sat on the patio as we always we do and they totally FORGOT about us. We ordered a sausage parm and an order of boneless wings. We didn't think anything of it at first because as I mentioned service isn't always speedy.  I big deal. But at the half hour mark, I figured I would check because the place was EMPTY. We were the only ones there. So I go in and the woman was surprised. She brought out our order in a bag. Not sure where the disconnect was, but basically it was prepared as a to go order and was just sitting back there getting cold. You would think they would remember that we were still there since we were the only ones there! My wings were lukewarm and the sandwich bread was soggy. My spouse went in to say something and the woman appeared to not know what he was talking about.

Bottom line, I'm writing this to let the owners know they need to look into the service here. There was a manager that used to be at this location (forgot his name but had glasses) and we always felt welcome and we never got forgotten.

We walked up and there was a sign that says ""Please wait to be seated"". Pretty standard, looks lively outside with a cover band on the patio so I'm thinking this place looks decent. Honestly was hoping for some truly authentic English food from across the pond since I've spent so much time there. 

We stood there for a minute or two on the sidewalk outside of the fence and finally decided to try and find a host or hostess by going to the main counter inside. We Walked through the main door and one of these preppy looking frat boys in a red shirt with short slicked back blonde hair yells at me and my partner telling us we ""must not know how to read."" I don't even have time to tell him we were looking for a host before he orders us, and I mean Orders Us like a butt hurt middle school principal, to walk back to the sidewalk and points at the sign and says ""What does this say!?"" Still, I can't even tell him wtf is going on let alone what the sign has on it before he says ""well I guess I'll just let you choose a table out here since that's what you decided to do."" 

We sat down and ate but the only reason we did is because we were hungry and had heard good reviews. The only things accurate to the theme on the menu were two kinds of English drafts and the fish & chips. The menu is a mess and nothing authentic really lives on it. I ordered  Nottingham because I truly didn't want to spend any money after how we were treated. The chicken was dry like it had been frozen then reheated while it was in sand which form. My partner got some roast beef sandwich and it looked like an absolute mess. 

Please also be aware we were not IDd when we purchased alcohol. This was a huge red flag and can lead to some serious legal issues.

Summing up, not good. Don't go here, extremely rude staff on hand. I don't care what your day has been like, as a customer service person myself who used to be a server I don't think any of this treatment toward a customer is acceptable or excusable so my partner and I will never be going back.",8/28/2021 6:18,0

So far I've tried their Pig and Chicken Pesto pizza and and their caprese skewers and caesar salad. All of which were great. 

Their Pig pizza is their take on a meat lovers with 
applewood smoked bacon, italian sausage, pepperoni, smoked ham & sopressata. This pizza became my dad's favorite pie after we brought him here for his Birthday this year. The Chicken Pesto is a bit more simple with white pizza with pesto chicken, fresh mozzarella & marinated tomatoes but definitely not simple in flavor. The Chicken is always moist and overall the flavor and seasoning are spot on. Their red sauce alone can be eaten by the spoon full too! 

I think what I love most is their pizza crust, especially their thin and crispy crust. Although you can choose from different crusts, original thin, traditional hand-stretched, and gluten-free for a slight upcharge.

Relocated to Tucson a couple years ago and have since been searching for a decent pizza (not an easy find in this town). We ordered the ""Canyon Combo"" - a standard house pizza. At first glance, the toppings were generous and evenly distributed - a nice presentation. BUT, as we began to eat, my wife and I instantly agreed - ""Something's missing"". The pizza seemed a little dry, which was from a lack of sauce (very little and not very flavorful). Also, the topping were not anchored to anything, which was due to a VERY thin layer of cheese. (I actually questioned, ""Is there ANY cheese on here?"") There were nice big slices of sausage, but that sausage had no flavor. The crust was a little soggy in the middle, but otherwise pretty good.

 For those of you not familiar with this establishment, it used to be a Fox restaurant, aka a place that had hip stylish food and surroundings catering to a Foothills-type crowd.  It has since recently been bought out by Cheesecake Factory, which wasn't entirely dissimilar in direction and concept,  but perhaps has made some unfortunate cheap choices in order to probably increase its bottom line.
Sauce has kept its original exterior personality, a fast food ambience with gourmet-style pizza/Italian food.  So you stand in line, strain your neck looking at a ""fancy"" handwritten-looking chalkboard menu that is by far too lengthy to be decisive in line; and you take a number and get your food rather quickly.  If you'd like a fancy drink with your faux, gourmet fast food set up, don't worry, there's nothing but cheap-ass fountain drinks.  This would be the type of place where I could get a local hand-crafted soda, but no, it's really a cafeteria.  Don't forget.  We don't want to spoil ya!
 I ordered the mac and cheese and added two meatballs.  I think everyone has an idea of mac and cheese as it's a traditional Americana meal.  Like it or not, it's got yellowy-orange cheesy creaminess with soft noodles.  This was invented before fat, butter, and calories really meant anything.  The ""Sauce"" version was hard crescent tiny noodles (al dente would be too kind) and no sauce, but some parmesan sprinkled on top.  There was a bit of goo on the bottom of the dish, but overall it was just dry hard noodles.  It was obscenely rude to serve this as a decent dish worth paying for.  The meatballs were adequate, but also lacking sauce.  But they were covered in red goo anyhow so it does nothing but overpower anything the mac and cheese would have provided anyhow.
 Speaking of red sauce, my dining partner ordered a pasta with red sauce.  Guess what?  He had to ask for sauce because there wasn't any.  The table servers were happy to provide as if they'd heard this before.  They also brought us silverware and napkins since our table had none, and butter for the bread rolls, which were served in paper bags even though we weren't going anywhere, and all this was provided after we had gotten our meals and left to figure out what we needed to eat our hard noodles.  My dining partner got a free cookie to apologize for everything.  This was all before I tasted my desert-dry pasta.
 I'm actually aghast at this food establishment.  It's sincerely the worst pasta dishes I've ever encountered.  The servers were quite accommodating and pleasant so that merits a star.  I will be anxious to see when the ""Where the.."" part of the sign lights up again to really reflect the stingy values.  However, now it's a good gotcha!  Chortle-chortle.",09-07-2021 17:45,0

Two chefs collaborated to bring forth something completely off the hook amazing and perfect.  We went on a Saturday early afternoon (I was prepared for a wait based on all of the reviews I've read).  One places his / her order at the counter (time to get used to this due in part to personnel shortages).  The menu is super interesting - I would say southwestern Italian fusion.  I'm certain that someone will correct me on that.  The beer / wine license hasn't been given yet.  No worries - RC cola products are available.  We started with elote arancini, and I chose the fettuccini alfredado.  What is that you ask?  It is an Alfredo sauce with chili Colorado.  That sounded great!  I got it with chicken added.   My husband ordered the rigatoni arrabiata (but no bread bowl).  We also ordered two fountain drinks.  
Music was playing, and it was at a pleasant volume.  Ample seating to choose from, and it is super clean.  It is decorated with vintage photos of Italian food being made.  And there is a huge pallet of Caputo flour in the middle of the floor - now that's awesome!
The chef brought out the arancini and then brought us side plates.  These little balls were a perfect fusion of delicious ingredients.  Risotto with corn kernels, and they seem to be coated in tempura before being fried.  Then, they are on a plate with a lime crema and topped with a little cotija cheese.  I had to share with my husband, but darn it, I wanted all of them!  They are light and flavorful, and the acidic notes in the crema were tart enough to break up the richness of the risotto.  And the coating!  Light and airy and just crispy!!!
Ok, then the mains came out.  Beautiful, vibrant colors and scents encompassed both dishes.  Mine also has roasted garlic cloves. Pure savoriness with no bitter notes.  The sauce was complex with both cheese and red chili spice, but not overly hot.  The fettuccine was perfectly prepared.  The chicken breast bits were still moist after being grilled.  Just a great dish.  I was so good I'm not licking the plate.  Tasty!!
My husband's dish was equally perfect.  Freshly-made rigatoni was the perfect vehicle to capture that spicy sauce.  Sometimes arabiatta can have an undercooked tomato sauce with a lot spice that leaves one sad.  Not here!!!!  It was a sauce that had time to cook those tomatoes down to a great flavor.  The spice level was great!  My husband ate all of the dish.  Every tiny bit.
I'm really looking forward to going back, as the menu is insanely inventive.  We should have ordered a pizza, as the oven looks like the giver of marvelous things.    This could be a restaurant to stalk several times a week to just try everything.  
Oh, and there is a patio, when Tucson isn't 100 degrees.  Again, so much goodness!  
So, sit back and enjoy, and let the two chefs that own this restaurant delight you!!!!",06-06-2021 22:22,1

It gets really busy from the college crowd and can get rowdy outside.
If you're coming here for food, I'd say try somewhere else, there's better places on the same street.

*Update after owner response* The owner has accused me of leaving a personal review when this had been my first visit here, now due to false accusations, I will now not be returning at all. 

My visit did occur a few weeks ago before a play at the nearby theater, so I do apologize for not leaving a ""day of"" review but that does not make mine invalid.

I read the reviews of this place before coming, seeing a lot of them complaining about a woman. I chose to ignore those bad reviews and give this place the benefit of the doubt but with the owner's response, I have sadly been shown the bad reviews are true.",01-02-2022 19:20,0

As customers we are reminded to have patience with businesses during this time.  As a member of the community still trying to support the economy...I feel the patience should work both ways.  I went in to have a sit down meal with my kids.  I ordered and walked through the dining area.  There was nowhere to sit a party of three, so we headed over to the drink area.  Once we completed filling our cups, we were still in the dilema of looking for somewhere to sit.  A staff member Quinn, came over to tell me I could not stand in the drink area. As I looked around, there were people waiting to order with others sitting in the reserved area infront of the cash register while other staff were utilizing the walk area between the kitchen and the high top table area.  Needless to say there was nowhere else we could stand while respecting those that abide by the 6ft distance between parties.  As I explained to Quinn, there was nowhere to sit, she gave me a blank look and stated well we cannot have you here.  With that said, I asked for my meal to be prepared to go.  In this environment no one was practicing social distancing, they were taking sit down orders for a dining area that was already full and did not have an area where those waiting could stand.  If they were so concerned of where I was standing they should not allow people in to sit down while all the tables are taken.  They were clearly over their COVID capacity.  What was even more upsetting was, the manager Rachel never addressed the situation...rather dodged the interaction all together.  In my opinion, if you are not going to allow customers to wait for a seat inside the restaurant, do not allow them to come in and place an order until they can be seated immediately after placing their order.  While waiting for my order to be prepared to go, it was clear the establishment was not practicing ANY social distancing other than the separation of tables.  Several parties stood next to meet while waiting for seating and to wait for to go orders.  I do not feel that I was a bother or in anyone's way or invading anyone's space by walking off near the drink area, on the contrary I was allowing room for those that were waiting to place an order.  Thinking about an environment where everyone should be more understanding, it seems some are becoming more unprofessional as this pandemic drags on.",3/17/2021 4:10,0

The -1 star is for the fries/onion rings shared basket. Both the rings and fries were way over cooked (almost burned on some) and the fries had this incredibly spicy seasoning on them which I didn't enjoy at all.

It's an interesting concept of Mexican Italian fusion even though my Italian friend suggested someone be burned at a stake for it. But I've come to realize if this fusion actually worked people would have done it already. But I digress this could be killer. 

First visit we found only two items that seems appetizing the corn risotto arancini and the birria pizza. Suffice it to say I was disappointed with the menu because I thought this was an Italian restaurant. I did not research or look into this place before going here. The arancini was fantastic. The pizza was good, but very heavy the squirt of lime really helped the flavor. So this visit wasn't bad so tried again. 

Second visit, but I must be clear this is a place with fine dinning prices but you have to order at a counter and get your own drinks. This time we ordered the arancini (it's good). Then we ordered three pastas to share, Alfredo, Parpaddelle, and the wolf pasta thing. Not sure if the pasta was cooked too soon and then poorly reheated or just cooked clumped, but the parpadelle and the fettuccine were just glutonous masses. If you fought with it you could loosen up the fettucine and spread the sauce. The parpadelle needed a knife and fork. The wolf pasta was done right. But they all just tasted bland. Had to ask for salt an pepper, I suspect there was a shortage because there wasn't any on the food. So I'd say stick with pizzas, but none of them really sound appetizing. This time we did get desert, both, the taco shaped cannoli and the chocolate cake topped with flan.  They were both good, but there is a reason why cannoli's have the tube shape, they're way easier to eat. 

I don't think I'll be trying this place again and that seems to be the honest assessment of the local area because we went on a Friday night and they were at half capacity and not because of covid restrictions.",09-04-2021 14:25,0

You could tell our server was annoyed, even though I told her I'd take a longer look and let her know the next time she came around, she didn't have to wait. Once we got our food, we didn't get silverware or napkins. My friend asked for a form (she had pasta) when the server walked by, but she left so fast I couldn't even ask her for mine. She dropped off a wrapped fork and napkin and walked away, again not giving us the chance to ask. I finally caught her and asked for a napkin, as my sandwich was pretty messy. I figured I'd get the same wrapped up napkin/fork (for my salad). Nope, she dropped off a napkin and kept walking. I finally said screw it and we got to go boxes and left.

Now you look through your fridge, and have some week old cucumber which you shred into slimy bits, old carrots that are starting to shrivel, a CAN of chicken you buy for 1.87 at the store, mealy tomatoes, and a granny smith apple you cut and let go brown. 
Well put all those sad ingredients together with some sun-dried tomato with feta and roasted garlic dressing that SHOULD save this mess but instead makes it some how worse? The issue as well was that nothing seemed okay seasoned, the salad dressing was made to do all of the work but it had no help.

So you try to add some quinoa, chipeas, and walnuts to see if you can save this still flavorless and bitter salad but you make it even more of a disaster?!? How is this happening? Now put some big tomato slices around the bowl and smack a $13.25 price tag on it and call it a salad worth charging people for.

BZ's will wake up your pallet and put a smile on your face again. Nothing boring there on the menu. Experience what a true Italian restaurant should taste like. 
I owned 3 restaurants in Tucson and if I were ever to start another it would be this one. Some of my favorites are the Good Fellas Pizza. And the unbeatable and (UNBELIEVABLE) Meatball  sub. This ain't your Auntie Roses Meatball Sub. This is a delicately blended flavor blast from Old Italian Roots brought here to the US. The marinara is as ever important as the meatballs. The Marinara is as grand as meatball and the bread is as good as any Philly cheese steak from back home. Hey!
The good fellas are right here.

Concerning BZ PIZZA
it's been awhile since I've eaten here. 
Let me tell you!   The food is the ultimate. 
I had the spaghetti and meatballs (4) meatballs come on a mound of pasta. 
Let's start with the pasta   The spaghetti alone without gravy will make you cry.  It's so flavorful perfectly homemade Italian seasoning. The marina very very good and perfect density with a little chunk to it. It's outstanding gravy. 
NOW LETS EVALUATE THE (MEATBALLS)
I'm sure that you have never had any meatballs as good as these. I'm from a Sicilian familia. Old world. As a child the family would gather at my Grandparents on Sunday. For the pasta and homemade pizza and meatballs and fresh Italian sausages. 
My grandparents came from Palermo in the 1920's. 
I would be a missing person if they were still alive for telling you this. EAT AT BZ's.  There's nothing better in this state.  Thank you Brian and Mike. 
You are a essential Business !!!!
I will eat there and recommend your fine dining in a casual atmosphere forever.

I ordered a Ranger sandwich and was given something else entirely. I included a picture. The sandwich sucked and I feel like I heavily overpaid for what I got. Even if they had the right protein the sandwich would have still been missing sauce, lettuce and tomato.

I didn't see the standard pepperoni pizza, but when I went to pick up our order I noticed someone ordering a pepperoni pizza. The umami tsunami was a flavor bomb and was by far the best pizza out of the two we order.  The broccoli was $8 (not worth it) and the portions were small for the overall cost we paid.

1 start for...everything else, so average it to 2 stars overall. 
We felt very uncomfortable: cheap chairs, bad location, table was dirty (they had to wipe it while we stood there awkwardly and then it had to dry), open restaurant set-up so everyone can see everything & you have to get up and order your food at the front and fill your own water or soda at a tall soda machine...again, where everyone can see you. That's all fine if that's the vibe you're doing, but then to have pretty expensive food which was SO delicious and then to be snobby when one person of our party asks to substitute something (cashier gives a deep breath, rolls eyes, and explains they are the ""pizza gods"" so they can substitute but don't like to). Ok ok....so you are fancy and snobby, then why am I eating this amazing food with the cheapest silverware and a thin paper napkin? Shouldn't I be experiencing luxury lighting, impeccable service telling me about the food and a freaking cloth napkin?

We got the food home and we were all really happy, the jalapeño popper pizza was a big hit, although too rich to really eat a lot, the flavor was really good and fun. The wings were all a big hit, and we were all really happy with the meal. A couple nights ago we decided to dine in with our two young kids. The girls that served us were SO on top of everything. They anticipated our needs, knew so much about the beer choices, and made helpful suggestions. They really went above and beyond talking to my dinosaur obsessed 4 year old. They saw me trying to cut our pizza into smaller slices for the kids, and instantly offered to take the pizza back and have the cooks do it for us.

The menu looked so good that we ended up ordering one of everything. Both appetizers were phenomenal, the tamale polenta was a nice spin on a polenta with a great hatch chile finish but the Elote Arancini was out of this world. Street corn and risotto combined with some queso fresco and lime crema elevated this dish to amazing heights. The Elote Arancini is a MUST ORDER item.

For our main courses we split both the Alfredorado and the Figgy Stardust pizza. The Alfredorado was good but not amazing, definitely a more interesting take on a fettuccine alfredo with the addition of red chile but nothing remarkable. The Figgy Stardust on the other hand was a standout. The crust is perfect, toasted and crisp while still pillowy in our mouth. I need to try all their pizzas now. 

For desert they offer a chocoflan or taconnoli and you can't go wrong with either. The chocoflan is a light custardy flan perched atop a small chocolate cake. It's as rich and decadent as it sounds.

A few minutes go by and one of the workers came out and verbally called a party of two who were there. I didn't have my phone on me and the hostess NEVER said they would text me when the table was ready. And also pairing it with someone coming out to verbally call for a party, I thought that's how they do it. 

So about THIRTY minutes go by and (NOTE: my husband and I are sitting directly adjacent to the host stand outside, and the hostess who checked us in could see us for almost that entire time) a couple who got there after us go in to get seated.

I'm annoyed at this point because they never came out to double check the people who checked in AND SHE COULD SEE US. There is NO way she would have forgotten we checked in such a short time ago. I also find it rather lazy to not come out to double check especially when she could LITERALLY SEE US. She was there almost the entire time so it's not even like she was busy with a million other things. 

I went up to the host stand and double checked and she kind of laughed and was like ""oh yeah it's been ready."" 

I was pissed. I get that the laughter could have been nerves or stress but there was ZERO apology. Nothing like ""I am so sorry, let me get you seated right away.""

I have been in the serving industry for a while and found her response extremely unprofessional. I was so pissed that we ended up leaving. 

We will never be coming back and went to Scordatos instead.",2/15/2021 4:26,0

there we had a front row seat watching lau the bartender practice the art of mixology.  he was very articulate and quick making drinks.  it was more than apparent he is a skilled bartender and loves his craft.

the food we enjoyed here was the ossobuci d'agnello con risotto and the lasagna al forno.  the portions were generous.  both were absolutely delicious.

i met karla the manager and was greeted kindly.  she was very approachable and modest.

We ordered a family meal with pasta and salad along with garlic rolls online, for a specific pickup time and paid ahead (with a tip). After arriving at the restaurant pickup area and waiting for 15 minutes past the scheduled pickup time, my husband went inside to check on the order... He was told that they were waiting on the salad.. About 10 minutes later they finally brought out the food and claimed that someone new had made the salad and messed up and then they couldn't find a container to put it in. REALLY? Ok, for starters, what is the point of preordering for a specific time if you cannot fulfill the order. I understand places getting busy, but shouldn't you make the prepaid orders that have a pickup time attached to them? And really, how long does it take to make a salad?? A few minutes? Not 10, and that sounds like there are some issues if there are no containers to put your to-go food in.. Just a suggestion, maybe don't offer to-go food if it is that much trouble. 
As for the food itself, the Caprese salad was fine, what you would expect; the Chicken Carbonara was fine, a generous portion; and the garlic rolls were horrible. Literally no cheese on them, and they looked like they had just taken some frozen dough out of the freezer and heated them in the microwave. Ugh. (Also packaged in weird containers- not sure how many were supposed to come in an order but we ordered 2 and got three in one box and 5 in another?)

Traditional style is wheat; however, there are gluten free options as well.

Not in the mood for pizza? Renee's also has lighter appetizer options and sandwiches. Our favorites are 1) the black bean tostada which is topped with a lovely salsa fresca and avocado that keeps it light and bright in flavor, and 2) the grilled cheese with tomato soup which is a delicious take on the classic comfort food - mozzarella and parmesan in between parmesan-crusted focaccia slices (aka cheese on cheese on cheese goodness). For dessert, highly recommend the cheesecake - it's unique in that it's made from goat cheese and topped with either a seasonal compote or Luxardo cherries.

So good in fact I could not wait to go back. So today, a friend and I did just that. On the way to Scordatos I talked it up so much that my friend couldn't wait to order. Sadly, today's experience was anything but the same great service I received prior. Today was met with poor service, poor presentation, no follow up, and both orders were completely scrambled. I'm always nervous when the server takes your order on memory instead of writing it down as most oftentimes there's a problem, and today, the mistakes were numerous.  But what added even more insult to injury was they did not seem to care.  Normally, I would have just chalked this up to a fluke but today's customer service sentiment left no doubt that their service and attention to detail depends on the server and not the position of the establishment.  If the Scordato family still owned this restaurant, I am certain the service would be consistently great, but unfortunately it's not. They could have saved themselves by JUST pretending they cared.  A customer service business [such as Scordatos] is generally judged at how they remedy or correct their shortcomings. When people speak up, they want to be heard instead of brushed off.  
Lately, people are afraid of being labeled as a ""Karen"" for speaking up.  Well, I grew up in the customer service business and I will continue to both praise and speak up. 
Sincerely,
""Mr. Karen""",8/30/2020 3:52,0

It's become a go-to restaurant for us because of the great service, gluten-free options, excellent food quality, and nice ambiance.  Plus it's easy to park.

Yesterday, Sophie was our server, and she really does an OUTSTANDING job.  She's excellent as a server, and as a human being.  Seriously, she's attentive, has great timing, solid menu knowledge, and is very personable and just fun to have as a server.  She acknowledges you quickly, makes sure to check on drinks while you're waiting for food, and takes great care of you.

Usually I have a pasta dish (I love Nonna Antionetta's Pasta Al Forno and the fettuccine Alfredo) but this time I was in the mood for steak, and my wife's had the steak here before and said it was very good, just about as good as the high end steakhouses.  But then I saw the swordfish and changed my mind.  It did not disappoint.  It was nicely grilled with the char lines, tasted really good, meaty, but not fishy.  My wife did get the steak again.  Nice sized ribeye, well-marbled, very flavorful, and cooked to the right temperature (medium well for her) - she gave me a small portion to taste, I really liked it.

They've got some nice fancy cocktails too.  I don't think the drink I had is on the online bar menu, it was a special summer drink, and it had an orange peel, and was a nice sweet fruity drink but not too sweet.  Really enjoyed it.

AND we both got pizzas to go.  They do a GREAT job with pizza (my gets the gluten-free pizza and the crust is not bad).  Crust is excellent here.  Which now that I think about it, the bread is so good here, must be why the pizza is good.  They are dough masters.

AND I got a cannoli for dessert to go.  Usually I'm a traditionalist for cannolis but I noticed the strawberry and it was great!

And all that food did not break the bank at all, and we weren't even here for happy hour.

Skyline Drive, in the Foothills. At 11:30 am, this Northern Italian styled restaurant was not crowded. We were greeted at the door; We requested a booth, and within seconds we were seated.  
   Our server, a gentleman named Alan, introduced himself, and gave us menus. Alan's attention to our requests was simply unmatched! It was as if he could read our minds. He wasn't there too much, nor did we go without; Alan was the best server that I have had, and I am in my sixties!
   My friend ordered an Anatra Salad. It looked just as good as it tasted! The salad came with mixed greens, cranberries, walnuts, orange slices, a wood fired duck breast, and a tasty honey mustard vinaigrette. My friend quieted down, and for a while our conversation stopped-that was because she was enjoying her selection. She let me try her dish, so I speared some lettuce, an orange slice, some walnuts and a piece of duck. Then, I began to understand why she was quiet, it was fantastic!
   I had ordered the Salamino Piccante Pizza. And when it arrived, it appeared to be just what I had wanted. The combination of mozzarella, parmesan, tomato sauce, and spicy Italian salami was more than pleasant. It met, and filled my need for pizza! The crust was thin and mostly crispy; Pizza Nirvana!
   On the way out, the manager got up from her station and held the door for us (my friend and I both walk using a cane). This has never happened to me in three years of my needing a cane. I felt as if she was treating us like normal human beings: More so, she made us feel normal again, THANK YOU!!!

We arrived at 5:25 PM and called the number to let them know we had arrived a few minutes after 5:30 PM. They told us they were very busy and it would be a few minutes which we understood. My husband decided to wait on the patio and he waited for about 10 minutes and nothing so he asked and he felt the answer from the person working was curt as she said 5-10 minutes longer. We finally got our food around 6 PM and even though they gave us a free dessert for the delay with an insincere apology, my husband felt he had been blown off. 

When we sat down to eat, my husband was still upset with how he was treated but we decided it was worth the hassle if the food was good. Well.....two of our three dishes were over cooked. The meat lasagna was PERFECT; unfortunately our favorite dish the chicken pesto lasagna was over cooked as was the chicken pesto pizza. 

We love Renee's and are still surprised at our experience and the overcooked food. At some point we will try takeout again and we hope to experience a much better end result.",2/16/2021 5:03,1

I placed a large order over the phone and went to pick it up after church. Service was awesome and they even gave me a discount although I didn't even ask for one. We had a variety of of the pizzas. 11 in total. There pizzas are huge! Be careful when ordering lol. We ended up not finished 5 of them. Lefts overs I guess. We also had wings but they weren't anything to rave about. Just your standard deep fry wings tossed in traditional sauces, ie bbq, Buffalo, etc. The staff helped carry the pizzas out to the car and had wonderful attitude.

She got the awesome Bonet dessert (chocolate custard, amaretti, whipped cream & caramel sauce) and ate every last spoonful.

With the delightfully soft, sliced bread and olive oil, it was a lovely combination.

The downside:
  - The $18 gamberoni alla griglia (shrimp n' beans) appetizer was tasteless.
  - The room is dominated by an obtrusive, bright TV showing basketball. At a white tablecloth restaurant, why would you have a glaring TV that you can't avoid? I wanted to throw a towel over it.
  - Turn on your cell flashlight because it's mighty dim.
  - The sound level at 7 pm was as loud as Times Square in New York during rush hour. We sat should-to-shoulder and still had to repeat ourselves when talking because we couldn't hear.

The chicken parm was delicious and a great portion.  The tortellini was also very tasty, and the portion was indeed generous.  The bottle of water on the table to allow for self refilling is not only a great idea for COVID issues, but a fantastic means of us always having water without someone reaching over us throughout the meal.

The only reason that this was not a five-star review for us was that the food took a very long time to come out as evidenced but the waitress that stopped at the table three times to ask if we had even received our salads yet.

We walked in at 747 pm after two other attempts to grab a Thursday dinner after a long crazy week. Two other places had waits of 40+ minutes. Scordato's is around the corner from my house and for some reason it just hasn't popped up on our radar as a go-to. But that all changed after our experience this week. Walking in, practically foaming at the mouth, we were informed quickly by the host / manager that there was no wait, but we'd have to order within 12 minutes because the kitchen was closing at 8. No problem. We quickly found the menu filled with Italian and family staples: pizza for the boys, chicken parm for the daughter, and pesto tortellini for mom. Drinks were quickly delivered after we ordered. There was a bit of an eternity of a wait for our dinner (I blame the chicken parm and our hangry stomachs for making it seem like a long time), but once the food arrived we were impressed with not just the portions but the flavor packed absolutely amazing meals. Boys devoured the pizza with crispy small pepperoni, the kind that seems to melt in your mouth, my tortellini was flavorful and perfectly cooked, and the chicken parm portion was enough for two (I had the second half for lunch the next day). Without a doubt Scordato's just hit high on our go-to for family dinner. The kids all raves about their dinners and even said so the next day: ""that was really good pizza!""

Domino's pizza is the same anywhere, so if you've had it once and liked it, you know what to expect. If you've had it and hate it, again, you know what you're getting into. The problem with living on Davis Monthan is that the delivery options are limited. Until recently, we assumed the Papa Johns on base was the only pizza (or any) delivery available. Then someone mentioned Domino's delivers on base too. 

To start, they have better deals (currently) than Papa John's, so we gave them a try. I saw online the store is close to the base, within a few minute drive. So, after an hour of waiting on our food, and the order tracker saying the driver had left 25 minutes earlier, I called the store. The person who picked up said the driver was probably delivering multiple orders and if he wasn't there within another half hour, to call back. 

Thankfully, the driver showed up during this phone call because if it got to be much longer, I wanted to just cancel the order and get a refund. I understand the Pandemic has caused a lot more people to choose delivery or take out, but we were quoted 38 minutes for an order that showed it was done in less time and took a crazy long time to show up. It was also luke warm when it got here and the oil from the pizzas had soaked the entire boxes. It wasn't appealing at all. 

We'll just stick to Papa Johns, but I wanted to let others who live on base know what they're possibly getting. For those curious, this wasn't a Friday or Saturday night order either when times are likely to take longer. It was a weekday at nearly 8pm.",12/16/2020 8:01,0

The employees weren't washing their hands as the went from handling the phones, touching the register, then going back to making food.

Among my favorites from them are the Roasted Three Mushroom pizza (a creamy fontina base with mushrooms, green onion, and Grana Padano shavings), Sausage and Roasted Cipollini Onion pizza (tomato sauce base, mozzarella, sausage, onion, and sage), and the Spicy Calabrian pizza (tomato sauce base, fontina cheese, calabrese salami, and calabrian peppers). Another excellent choice is the Chicken Meatballs and Ricotta Cheese pizza (tomato sauce base, fontina cheese, sliced chicken meatballs, fresh basil). 

They provide an herb oil with the pizza, and it's absolutely delicious on the crusts. Regardless of what kind of pizza you get, you'll definitely want to be dipping your crusts as you finish each slice.

We show her the phone with our bank statement on there & it clearly shows that we did make the order & it was obviously taken off our card. We show her expecting that a manager will come out & offer to start our order again & sorry for the inconvenience, but instead we are told that we can buy another pizza if we'd like? They weren't kidding either! Why would we buy another pizza when we already ordered a pizza & paid for it. She was as rude as anybody I've ever dealt with when all we wanted was what we paid for already. She says that if we aren't going to order another pizza then we can call tomorrow morning when a manager is there & get the refunded money put back on her card, ""if we in fact did pay for the pizza"".!?  Seriously! Now I left a two star review because the food here is delicious but the service has been rapidly declining! This isn't the first time I have had an issue with the service here! I swear I think most of the staff is on drugs! But the food is good. Now I will retract my review if management goes above & beyond to make this right! Walking a total of 3 miles for something we obviously paid for but didn't get to enjoy because of a mistake on their end of this deal is unacceptable! Her attitude was completely unacceptable & now I starve tonight! We live check to check so buying another pizza or food somewhere else is not going to happen.

Open again, 5 stars all the way. My wife had the Lamb Chop Lollipops. She said they were fantastic. I had a piece of it and it was really tender, the mint pesto had a fantastic taste to it as well. 

We had the Porchetta Sliders and they have great taste to them. I think for myself I would like some sort of a barbecue sauce on them. 

We also got the fried goat cheese with chili jam and roasted garlic. It was fantastic. The chili jam had just enough heat to get your attention but also had some sweetness.

Last, we had the meatball sliders which were also fantastic. The meet was tender and flavorful as well as the sauce and the cheese. All of it was awesome and the bonus was some of these were on the happy hour specials.",6/21/2020 0:52,1

Scordato's was on my regular rotation for a several years when they were located at St. Philip's Plaza. When they moved to this new location, while I missed the ambiance of the St. Philips, the food was the same for the time that Danny was there. Perhaps over time they have changed ingredients. The pizza dough is more crunchy and cracker like than the original. We ordered a margherita,  mushroom and the Zucchini pizza. The mushroom was the most notably difference .It was a giant pile of mushrooms on a flat crisp- it was missing the creaminess of the fontina. The only thing that resembles the original Scordato's was the herb oil for dipping bread and pizza crust. 

The pizza's are enormous- ordering 3 for a party of 4 was a lot of food. There were left overs. Ordering for pick-up was easy. You can pay inside or over the phone .",12/16/2020 18:27,1

Our group seating was a dumpster fire. They sat us next to a set of doors leading our on to the patio area which a server came in and out of every 30 seconds.  It was loud and disruptive to our table. It would have been similar to seating in the parking lot.  In fact that may have been better now that I think about it.  We asked to have it fixed and they blew us off.  It continued and we asked to be moved to another table. We were moved and we got our meals.  At that point it was like we were in time out and forgotten about.  The food was good overall but not enough to entice me to comeback.

I live in Hereford, 75 miles SE of the Old Pueblo, and make Tuscon a day trip:  I shop at Costco, do some urban trails, try out a brewpub, and then find a cool place to eat.  My choice last Friday night was a 20"" cheese pizza for my husband and me from Empire Pizza.  It did not disappoint.

There are several delicious-sounding pizzas on the menu, but my husband will only eat either a cheese pizza or a pepperoni pizza, so my only choice for take-out was a huge cheese pizza, a thin pizza with a doughy-chewy crust and lots of cheese. It got my husband's approval.

The pub part is temporarily closed during this pandemic.  The pizza place is take-out only and the wait is long.  I was warned that it would take 45 mins to an hour for my pizza.  I was fine with that as I got to sip beer at a brewpub across the street and walk around before standing in line for my pick-up, where several people were already waiting for their food, including one woman who clearly was not mentally well and cussing at everyone.  The place does great business and the hours are ideal for hungry late-night customers! Parking may be an issue during office hours, but after 5pm parking is free.

I ordered one of the signature drinks and our waiter said they were out of St Germain, okay two of us ordered a lemon drop instead (way too tart)!  They brought us the burrata bruschetta we ordered and the bread was burnt (black), I like it dark but this was crazy, however the bread they bring to the table for free is amazing!  We started to order dinner and I wanted veal piccata, I was told they didn't have veal tonight.  Okay, this is why I picked the restaurant to begin with.

Part 1

On October 30, 2021, we ordered several items for carry out. 

TAGLIATELLE ALLA BOLOGNESE, carpaccio di Manzo (which I can't find on the menu), PENNE AI FUNGHI, TAJARIN AL NERO DI SEPPIA and MILANESE (veal milanese).  I will talk about the veal in part 2.

The bolognese pasta and carpaccio di Manzo were very good! The mushroom pasta taste was amazing!! Although, the mushroom sauce seemed to have lots of dirt pieces in it, probably from the mushrooms, I'm guessing. The spaghetti w/black squid ink was pretty good, too.

Part 2

The $36 MILANESE (veal milanese) looked a little troubling, very oily and dark brown on one side & on the edges of the other side (see pictures). The taste was lots of carbon, on the parts cooked too much, and when removing the burned parts, it tasted more like calamari than veal. We've talked about this with the restaurant, and are hoping for a response that can rectify this bad experience.

We used to live in Sicily (Cefalu) and my better half is a trained chef, so we're conversant with the dishes and we feel we understand the preparation and what to expect in terms of a result.  The restaurant is quite nice, the setting is upscale, lively and decorated tastefully, taking advantage of the great Oro Valley mountainscape.  The help is pleasant (reception) to excellent (wait staff).  The price/value ratio is fair - we saw no problem there.  The appetizers antipasto, burrata salad and the meatballs w/ricotta were exceptional.  Really great flavors.  Problems arose with the pastas and the main plates.  Pastas (in concept) we're good and well presented. However in prep and flavor fell down hard: pasta marina, seafood nice, pasta mushy overcooked, salsa Bianca lacking any consistency and flavor. Weak and watery.  Penne, mushroom pesto not great.  Pesto extremely dry, not enough oil, pasta again mushy, overwhelming with garlic but lacking any other seasoning, the basil barely noticeable.  Poor.  The chicken parmigiana once again pasta mushy.  The dish also lacked seasoning, flat & boring.  Most disappointing was the Pork Marsala.  Looked great, but, no flavor to speak of.  Marsala is a rich sweet wine, the sauce had no flavor of Marsala at all.  It was a thin au jus like one might find at the prime rib station on a cheap buffet.  No detectable seasoning.  The dish was a boring flop, although the meat was tender.   The single best dish was the tortolloni.  The sauce was a rich Alfredo style, the seafood tasty and the tortellini & sauce cooked right - it was flavorful and satisfying.  Most of the food (except the tortolloni) was not finished.  No complaints were made, we weren't looking for freebies or discounts.  It was all edible, just disappointing. Why?? Because someone there knows what good food is - they just need to get the kitchen executing properly.  It was sad, that they are this close to really good and potentially excellent.  But they are not putting it out the way it ought to be.  Finishing up, the 2 desserts were wonderful (Popes Pillow & berry cheesecake) - couldn't have been better. Coffee tasted well, but not hot enough, just slightly above room temperature.  Waiter was attentive, responsive and welcoming - great server.  We'll go back - I suspect they need a change in the kitchen to bring the flavors and preparations up to the potential of their excellent concept.",11/15/2021 4:16,1
5qHG7Zdil_jRIepkayVR3A,pcNvt0FK-atXEpgVKp3ywA,FjRH6l8aQOmfXuo00lheLA,1,0,0,1,"I've left a couple of 5 star reviews for Broadway pizza in the past.  When I first moved here 5 years ago, it was my first choice... always.  Then the food got a  inconsistent.

A couple of years ago I had a bunch of friends staying with me before we drove down to Mexico and we got several pies.  1/2 the pies were made with the regular dough and 1/2 the pies were made with some new dough that the distributor wanted them to try out.  The new dough was terrible. 

They got back on track for a while and then again again it became inconsistent.  Shortly after that if I wanted Broadway Pizza I had to go by myself because my family wouldn't eat there.

I picked up my kids tonight and my Brother, who was with me for the dough experimentation a couple years earlier, went over to Broadway to pick up the pizza.  The guy up front was very nice.

I noticed the guy making the pizza was pulling anchovies out of the can and sticking them on the cooked pizza.  I asked about this.  The guy at the front said sometimes the toppings go into the cheese.  This has been my experience with all pizza toppings and is my preferred method.  It's also the way they used to make the pizzas as you can see from my previous reviews and pictures.  The maskless pizza maker tried to cook the anchovies separately and put them on top of the pie.  He then brought the pizza out to me without his mask.

When we got home, the box was already soaking through with grease, the crust sucked and was soggy (I'm about 6 or 7 minutes away) from Broadway Pizza.  My kids hated it so I'm having burgers delivered now while I'm typing this review.

I've been here many times, but this is the last.  Do what you will with your pizza, but put a mask on like the rest of us.  Give me a break!",11/22/2020 1:18,0
A1X_WQj8JKMGVQ8TlIIZtA,HdOr1TRuBz2svboJUUlmIA,ePTpnoMhgB71H4uqsNLd-g,5,1,0,1,"I'm torn on what sort of rating to give the total familial experience, so let me be clear on this one point: I cannot have dairy and my rating is based on my experience of ordering a calzone from Magpies with no dairy in it. 

Also, as per usual, since we ordered in,  I am not sure which store the food came from. All I can say is that I have been told everything from ""It's all right"" to ""It's nowhere worth the price."" to ""It sucks!"" before now, by two family members that, apparently, ordered to go, together, years ago. 

I kept wanting to give it a try, but never got the opportunity before a few days ago. Now that I have, I can tell you that I agree, mostly, that it isn't worth price and it is just all right. I have had way better tasting calzones and the price per topping is a bit insane! I could have gotten a cheaper, better tasting, bigger calzone from Black Jack's. 

  For the pizza I ordered for my son, the price was a bit outrageous for the pizza being so small, the crust so thin and only having three toppings on it.  

If I could eat cheese, I would not be writing an ""It's Great!"" review. I would be writing an ""It's okay, if someone else is paying for it."" review.  I found the general taste and thickness of the calzone, and amount of toppings, sparse but adequate to feel like I ate something. 

Two things make it ""great"". The first is the non-dairy cheese substitute they use, which, unlike the only other time I tried one in a restaurant setting (that one on a pizza) was actually melty, instead of just seeming snotty. It gave me hope and good feelings. 

As a mild third things, I shall tell you that my son said his leftover pizza was really great tasting the next day. He said when he got it, it was only okay to eat, but the flavors improved overnight. So, maybe I will order again and be sure and have only part of my calzone with a salad.  

Are you counting the things? I said two. I gave you one and then a third one. But, actually both things are related to the non-dairy cheese substitute. Because, I got weirdly gassy, headachy, but, seriously full of mental clarity and I woke up this morning seeing things differently and seeing some things I normally would not, as they would just be too far away to make out. 

As it was the only thing really different about my life, I said ""I have to find out what that vegan cheese stuff was made from.""  Turns out it is cassava and arrowroot. So, since I had arrowroot before, a bit, I looked up cassava and found out when you eat it, it will attack bacteria and viruses - which can cause you to be gassy, headachy and such from when the bacteria dies -and it will also, quite possibly, cause you to see and think better.

Okay, then! That's a good reason to find the adequate calzone passing into the realm of being great! An enjoyable non-dairy cheese substitute that made it so I indulged in restaurant food and came off with better health? 

Yeah ... I'd definitely order from Magpie's again for that!",7/30/2021 5:12,1

The food walks the line between comfortable and fancy, so it feels like it's a step up from the more casual Italian spots in town but remains approachable. It can work for special occasions, business dinners, or -- if you catch happy hour -- just a night out with friends! 

I recently ate there with a large group (eleven of us all together), and we had a lovely evening. We all ordered assorted drinks, and shared a couple salads and appetizers. The Caprese Burrata (mozzarella, tomato, basil, and olive oil) was good, as was Cavoletti Di Brussel (brussel sprouts with salami and a balsamic reduction). The salads were fine, but honestly, I'd probably skip them unless you really want to get some leafy greens in during dinner. 

Most of us chose pastas for our entrees, which we shared around. The best of the bunch were the Penne Alla Boscaiola (penne pasta with sausage, mushrooms, and a creamy tomato sauce), the Tajarin Al Nero Di Seppia (squid-ink pasta with shrimp and tomatoes in a white wine sauce), and the Penne Ai Funghi (penne pasta with various mushrooms and spinach in a creamy white wine sauce). Both ladies who got the penne dishes subbed in the house-made pasta, which was delicious. Each of the three aforementioned dishes were hearty, rich, and generously-sized. The Ravioli Al Caprino (beet pasta filled with goat cheese and herbs in tomato sauce) was quite good as well. 

For dessert, I recommend the Bonet (chocolate custard with caramel and whipped cream). It's incredibly rich -- definitely good to share if you don't want to overdo it. 

The restaurant, while generally comfortable, is dimly lit and very loud. It was difficult to hear the person even directly next to you. Even so, the boisterous atmosphere was fun for a big group outing! 

Be aware that the dinner menu can get pricey quickly if you're doing appetizers or drinks, as well as if you get a fish or meat entree rather than pasta; if you want to keep the price down, check out their happy hour.",2/17/2020 1:41,1

I was lucky that someone near the door left, because parking was scarce. I was surprised they didn't have reserved parking for pick-up orders. For curbside, you call the number they have posted. It was easy and they picked up quickly.
I got my food very quickly, too. Speed is definitely a perfected skill here! In all, service was great.

I expected thin crust with charred edges, which is what I got. The thin crust is a bit to crispy for my taste (this is just personal preference), so next time I would get the thicker crust.

I got a red sauce pizza with mild sausage, mushrooms, and roasted garlic, and garlic cheese bread. The two main reasons for my low rating is that there was almost no cheese on the pizza. There was one piece with no cheese at all. Second, the garlic wasn't roasted it was practically raw. Roasted garlic is soft and golden and sweet. This barely had heat touch it and wasn't soft.

When a good third of each slice is all crust, you just gotta say this isn't a great pizza, and if that's what they are teaching the servers, then we will be very hard pressed to go back. So their pitch of all the toppings for one price starts to break down when you can't get enough of those toppings to cover a whole slice! Consider yourself warned...",6/14/2021 0:23,1

Happy hour offers a nice selection of eats and drinks at half-off the regular. Like the panzanella salad for $4.5 or the mozzarella burger and fries for $8.5. And a 10"" pizza and featured bottle for $28. Great deals all around. 

But I give 5 instead of 4 stars for the prickly-pear lamb chops with lemon and mint pesto, also for $8.5. From Tuscany to Tucson-y, it's a nice local twist on an old school dish. And I ended up ordering extra bread (which was delicious) to clean up the leftover prickly-pear reduction. 

I didn't love the calamari calabrese. The calamari is machine cut (aka bulk processed and frozen). So it's essentially flavorless without the two sauces. This is Tucson after all, so fresh seafood is hard to catch here.  But who cares, it was only $4.5!

The Bottega crowd is lively and talkative, from teens to retirees. And the staff is warm and welcoming. So you'll probably end up making a friend or two. And the regulars will probably remember your name next time you come.

For years I've driven by Scordato's Pizzeria on Stone and River and turned up my nose at what I THOUGHT was just another corporate-chain pizza joint. Maybe it's because I've taken too many business trips to Florida where places like ""Pizzeria Uno"" thrive despite bad food and 90's era forest-green and brown decor. Uhg.

Little did I know the Scordato family has actually been in the Tucson food business since Daniel Scordato's father, Jim Sr., moved from New Jersey to open a restaurant here in 1972. 

So, I was wrong. Scordato's Pizzeria, despite that same dang forrest-green and brown decor, has a well-deserved place in Tucson's rich and diverse culinary history. 

More importantly, the pizza is FANTASTIC. The crust is crisp on the bottom with an audible crunch. Light and airy, or ""pillowy"" as they say, with a really nice char around the edges from the high-heat oven. It's served on a perforated pizza dish, which keeps the crust crisp throughout the meal. The sauce is flavorful, bright and acidic, but not gloopy or overpowering. And the cheese is creamy but not too greasy. 

I ordered my standard toppings: Pepperoni and mushroom. The pepperoni was salty and flavorful, with a hint of heat. The mushrooms were fresh, but a bit dense, maybe because they were halved in shape and full of moisture. They weighted down the crust quite a bit. So if anything could be better with this pizza I would suggest dehydrating the mushrooms separately before putting them in the oven. And/or slicing them in thinner pieces. 

But no matter, this 16"" pizza was fantastic and I would order it again any day of the week. 

From what I've read, the Scordato family sold this pizzeria in 2018. But I hope whoever owns it now never changes the pizza formula. And maybe if they have the money to update the decor, along with a functional website and decent media presence, new life could spring from old gem with generational Tucson roots.",4/17/2021 2:51,1

The second pizza was even worse, it had the ranch drizzle added onto it and they still just tossed the cups on top of it. And they hardly even fill these ranches! They are barely a quarter full.

We made weekday reservations for 6:30pm and our table was waiting.  By the way, don't let the credit card reservation process intimidate.  This is a small, upscale establishment with very limited seating during Covid.  If you declare a table, you do so at the exclusion of others, so yes, quaint/intimate Renee's will have to dock you $10 if you don't show!

We had zucchini pasta and, on Renee's personal recommendation, opted for the gluten-full pesto sauce :)  It was perfect, and so were the loooong tender strands of zucchini pasta.  We also ordered the greek salad.  It too was perfect, and large enough for two.  We devoured the oven-toasted focaccia that came with both the salad and the pasta... and Renee brought us two more slices - not a good day to mind your carbs, but this is a cheat worth having.

Prices are commensurate with organic and locally-sourced ingredients, that is $15-20 per entree, but with restaurant food, you get what you pay for.  Definitely a treat and a great call for our occasion.",09-09-2021 05:00,1

We tried a couple of appetizers - calamari and a cheese board which were good. However, the dinners we ordered were not prepared well.

I ordered the Cioppino Alla Ligure.  The broth was tasty and the pasta was fine. The fish and mussels were good but the shrimp and scallops were overcooked and on the chewy side.  

My wife ordered veal saltimbocca and she described the veal as tough and flavorless. She only ate about half of the dish and pushed the rest aside.

What was most interesting was that a manager asked me what I thought about the food and I told him - in a nice way - that I was not happy with the cioppino and why. He said he would tell the chef and then walked away. Hope the next customer got a satisfactory seafood stew - felt like the kitchen staff was being trained at my expense.

Everyone worked to get him safely into Jim's car and he and another employee drove him home, all the way to the next town.

NHyGON1ApAlHMJ4TU4z8OA,mJy-5ShuwwYRayxRtl6xxA,3TNaIkVUKrHzeeWMo9DMkg,3,1,0,0,"Empire Pizza is fine.  For Tucson pizza (NY style), it's maybe slightly better than fine.  For me, it's very hit or miss.  Sometimes you get a giant slice, sometimes you get a regular slice, and sometimes you get a slice that looks like it's nothing but crust.  If you order toppings, you might get one or two pepperonis, or if you're lucky, five.  Way too random for me, I just want to go in and get what I expect for the price I'm paying.  

The dough is almost always under done, as well, even with the garlic knots.  The knots are way, way too oily and way too under garlicky.  They also don't come with any red sauce, which to a NY Italian is very strange.  I don't want a ball of oil dough on its own, I want it with some sauce.

Their sauce is ok, the cheese is ok.  The meat quality is ok.  Nothing amazing, but it's fresh.  The dough is bland and needs more salt.  I know I sound negative, but despite all of this, the slice is fine.  Worth eating if you're craving pizza.  Definitely worth eating if you're looking for a fast bite downtown...

Unless they're busy, then the wait time for a slice of pizza can be unacceptable.  Over 20 minutes sometimes.  Basically, if their patio is full, don't bother.  

The employees never seem quite happy to be there, but they always seem to be working hard.  The pricing is fine overall, and the menu is pretty standard with some other cool pie combinations.  The elote pie is very good (hold the cilantro, though!).

I'm not the easiest person to impress and always give 100% honest reviews, even when they are tough. Fortunately, bottega Michelangelo made this five star review very easy! Who would have thought this incredible Italian restaurant would be found in Tucson, Arizona?? This review is a bit long, but worth the read. See the pictures of our dishes. WARNING, it's going to make you hungry!

We made a dinner reservation for a table on the patio. The friendly staff sat us immediately when we arrived at a beautiful little table on the front patio (there's a rear patio also). The front patio is encircled by a pony wall with decorative wrought iron fencing and dotted with trees and flowering plants wrapped in soft white lights. It's far enough back off the street that you really don't hear traffic and this evening felt kind of romantic. We sat near a patio heater to keep us toasty. The atmosphere was soft, comfortable, relaxed and inviting. We each started with a glass of wine. They happily provided us samples to ensure that we could choose a wine we really liked. They immediately brought homemade bread and the best olive oil/balsamic vinegar dipping sauce I've ever had. The homemade bread was warm and crusty on the outside and soft, pillowy, chewy, steamy and delicious on the inside. Clearly, made with love from the finest ingredients. The olive oil and balsamic dipping sauce was, as I said, was the best I've ever had. They add something to make it sweet and rich, it was fantastic and addicting! Was hard to practice enough self-control to not ruin dinner by eating plate after plate of bread and oil. They kept the bread and dipping sauce coming all night with warm and friendly service consistently.

Food: We started with the Mammas Housemade Meatballs appetizer and an order of roasted Balsamic Brussel sprouts. The meatballs were literally the best I've ever had in my life, warm, smooth, creamy and hearty, made from beef, pork and veal with a massive dollop of the best homemade ricotta cheese ever, it was creamy and salty and heavenly! The Pomodoro sauce, which elsewhere is typically a bit vinegary and unremarkable, was fresh, buttery, flavorful and amazing! This was in the top 10 appetizers I've ever eaten. The brussels sprouts were heavily roasted, but not burnt at all, they were crispy on the outside, smoky and soft inside with just the right amount of crunch and steamy freshness. The balsamic sauce was thick and sweet, with the Brussel sprouts placed on top, a perfect match of sweet and salty, crunchy and smoky. We ordered Linguini Marina which has shrimp, clams, muscles and calamari and an order of Bucatini Carbonara for entrees. WOW, wow, wow! The noodles all  tasted and felt homemade, thick, warm, chewy and stretchy. The linguine was delicious and packed with seafood, four huge shrimp, and plenty of the other seafood. The sauce was rich yet light and the dish was served piping hot and fresh. Excellent! My Bucatini Carbonara was one of the best pastas I've ever eaten in my life, even after vacationing in Italy. The noodles were perfectly cooked, thick, chewy, stretchy and warm. The cream sauce was phenomenal, incredibly rich, buttery, garlicky and flavorful with the perfect amount of black pepper, garlic and plenty of small pieces of thick cut, smoky bacon. The following is something I've never seen before and was incredible! They soft boil an egg, then lightly batter and deep fry it, then place it on top of the pasta with an Italian parsley garnish. You cut open the egg and the warm, creamy, perfectly cooked yolk mixes with the pasta and cream sauce to make it even more thick and rich. The pieces of white egg with the light, crunchy breading add a phenomenal texture and taste to the entire dish. Both pastas were outstanding!

Value: The prices here are very reasonable particularly for the quality and craftsmanship of the food and the portion size. We took quite a bit of both pasta dishes home with us due to the generous portion sizes and thick, rich, quality ingredients that filled our happy bellies.

Dessert: because they offer an assortment of incredible looking desserts, that they are famous for, we ordered a massive slab of homemade carrot cake with multiple cream cheese layers and cream cheese frosting to share. It was incredible, rich and creamy, clearly made with love and from the finest ingredients. We were absolutely packed and slept very well that night!

Bottega Michelangelo was FIVE STARS across-the-board, service, atmosphere, food, quality, portion size and value. Though it's an hour and a half drive each way from our home in Phoenix to this restaurant, we have already decided that it is well worth the road trip for another outstanding dining experience.

Like Macaroni Grill, they bring bread and a balsamic oil mix to dip. But the quality is much better, as they added garlic and red pepper.  I ordered the lollipop lamb chops and some calamari off the happy hour menu and shared some wine with family and friends. The lamb chops were fabulous. Just three smallish chops, nothing with it.

When we were vacationing in Tucson over Christmas, we were excited to see Renee's was open on Christmas Eve. We placed an order for 5:30 pick up at approximately 3 pm that afternoon. My husband wanted their meatball sandwich on gluten free bread and I ordered a calzone. We got their Oh Honey Board as an appetizer. For dessert a cheesecake and some vegan cinnamon rolls.

The restaurant does not allow any seating due to COVID 19 and does not allow anyone into the restaurant itself: when you want to pick up your food, you are to call inside the restaurant and a server will bring it outside on the patio for you.

We arrived a little early (5:15 pm) for our pickup order. I called inside and asked what the status of our order was. I was told it would be ready at 5:30. We killed 15 minutes by running a quick errand and came back to pick up the food at 5:30. I called inside again and was told the food wasn't ready yet: I was going to be another 15 minutes. We sat and waited. After another 15 minutes, I was told it was going to be another 15 minutes. (I kid you not.) The food was finally ready at 6:15 pm.

I understand Renee's discloses in their online ordering platform that pickup times are approximate and ""may be higher during peak hours"". But if the first person I had called had been honest with me about how long the wait really was, my husband and I could have gone and had a drink somewhere or otherwise done something with our time other than sit in our car in a parking lot on Christmas Eve. As I stood outside and waited for the order, several other people stood outside. Chatting with them, they were all having a similar experience.

When I received the order, I took all of the items out of the bag and counted them before I left: it was going to be a 30 minute drive back to our hotel and I wanted to make sure we had gotten everything we had asked for. Based on my count, we had the proper number of containers. But when we got back to the hotel and actually opened all of the containers, we discovered the container I thought had my husband's meatball sandwich was actually a side of bread and marinara sauce. My husband had no entree to eat and there was no way there would have been enough time for us to get Renee's team to make another one before they closed, not even taking into account the hour drive it would have taken for me to go and retrieve this missing food. As he doesn't eat gluten, I couldn't even split my calzone with him.

The online ordering system had also allowed me to choose three fillings for my calzone: I selected broccoli, basil, and artichoke hearts. When I dug into the calzone, I discovered there was only broccoli and chopped tomatoes inside.

The items we did receive tasted fine. The Oh Honey Board and the cheesecake were the highlights.

Overall, not a great first experience.",12/27/2020 22:48,1

Our server was Jacob, and he did a fantastic job!  He really knows the menu (both food and beverage) well, and helped us with the different choices, and was especially helpful navigating the gluten-free options.
In addition, he checked on us frequently and at the right times (which not all servers do as well as he did), like after delivery of food and/or drink items to ensure they were prepared and delivered correctly and to our satisfaction.

But there was another aspect of the service Jacob provided that stuck with us, and it's his very pleasant personality.  This young man is likable and personable and enthusiastic, and that alone enhanced our dining experience.  But when you couple that with his ""mechanical"" server skills, you just have a great time.  He was able to interact with us without impacting speed or efficiency - for us or any of his other tables.

We are definitely going to ask for Jacob when we return.

And the food was just as good as the service!  I had a hard time deciding between a one of the many pasta dishes, or the chicken parmigiana or a sandwich, and I went with the grinder, an awesome assortment of Italian cold cuts including mortadella (pistachio, mind you), soppresssata, and coppa, along with provolone, shredded lettuce, pepperoncini, and vinaigrette on delicious lightly grilled Italian bread.  It was warm and delicious.  One of the best sandwiches I've ever had!  And the fries that accompany the sandwich are also really good.

My wife was able to enjoy fettuccini Alfredo gluten-free (very nice of them to accommodate that request), and it was one of the better gluten-free pastas she's had, and the Alfredo sauce was really tasty.  She added grilled chicken which really put the flavor over the top.

On top of that, the house Pinot Grigio is pretty darn good and reasonably priced as well.

Also, we were very comfortable with their handling of COVID-19 health and safety protocols.  Every single staff member wore a mask, tables were not only distanced but when parties were seated, they were seated away from other tables if possible, patrons wore masks, and staff I think also wore gloves.

As dinner arrived we switched to a very nice and reasonable Oregon Pinot Noir - served on tap -- as well as a selection of pizza and pasta. You cannot go wrong with anything here!

The interior decorations were gorgeous! I would decorate my house the way the way the dining area is set up haha There's a cute patio in the back as well that seemed well lite.

The location is nice. There's a comfortable patio for outdoor dining. And the interior is stylish. 

The service was fine. We sat at our table for 15 minutes before being approached by anyone. They offered to comp one of our appetizers for the mistake without us complaining at all. So that was cool. 

But I can't say the food was overly exciting. The saltinboca was slightly dry and under seasoned. The prosciutto was over cooked to the point it was unrecognizable. For a dish that literally translates in English as ""jumps in the mouth"", it was just ok. Also the bolognese tagliatelle was dry and pretty bland. For $17, I definitely wouldn't get it again. 

But I'm rating 4 stars instead of 3 for the complimentary bread served for the table. It's delicious. Cooked in a high-heat oven, with char on the outside and a light doughiness inside, I could would go back just for that. Yummm.

The layout is large with many tables, yet still roomy enough so you dont feel cramned in.  The dining room was well lit but maybe just a bit too far on the bright side so it loses that intimate atmosphere one associates with fine Italian.  The seating is comfortable.  Even after the entire meal my back still felt I could take more time rather than be squirming in pain, anxious to get up and leave as I normally am.

The quality of the food is high.  One in our party requested a simple grilled chicken breast (not on the menu), which the server said would be no problem to accommodate.  My wife ordered the Ribeye Steak and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Even cooked well done she said it remained quite tender.  The roast veggies and fingerling potatoes were also perfectly cooked and tastey.  As good as the steak was, it did seem a bit overpriced  at $28.

I ordered the Tortelloni served with shrimp and langoustinos in a Calabrian chili cream sauce.  The tortellonis were cooked well - still a bit al dente.  There were only three shrimp and a few langoustines on the plate though.  While they were delicious I felt there should have been at least twice that number to justify a $23 pasta dish.  Although it was nice and tastey, something about the Calabrian cream sauce seemed odd.  Perhaps it was just the sauce's weirdly orange tint as it did taste nice.

For dessert I had a pistachio cannoli.  It was very nice.  It wasn't overly sweetened and the pastry itself seemed crisp and fresh.  I wish I could have ordered a second one without making a pig of myself.

All in all, Bottega Michaelangelo offers very good Italian fare, pleasant attentive service and a comfortable atmosphere at slightly immodest prices.  I would definitely return again.",1/21/2020 21:11,1

Another Yelper wrote that Empire is in his top three pizza joints and I have to agree with him. It's a shame I don't live closer, or else Empire would be my my #1 for the Tucson area. I ordered the Mulberry Street pizza and it tasted really good. I think I might be a bit unrealistic regarding how much sauce I like on my pizza, but Empire's version didn't make me feel like I was missing out. Plus, I like the dough they use - the crusts taste like yummy, little baguettes to me. I hardly ever eat pizza crusts, but I did this time around.

For the dessert sampler, I was given the cinnamon rolls, panna cotta, tiramisu, cheesecake, and pumpkin spice cheesecake. My favorites were the cinnamon rolls and cheesecakes. Don't get me wrong, all the desserts were tasty, but will for sure order the cheesecakes or cinnamon rolls again. The cheesecakes were rich and creamy, not to the point where you felt overloaded with sugar; and I don't really care for the pumpkin spice movement, but the plain and pumpkin spice cheesecakes really hit the spot. I saved the cinnamon rolls for breakfast and those were a soft, gooey, sweet treat.

Shame on me, because I should have known it would taste exactly like it sounded, which really was not good IMO. I mean, yes I like artichoke dip. But do I really want a calzone stuff full of the stuff?  Evidently not.  So I sent it back and got a different calzone. It was OK. It was improved with opening it up and putting some salt and pepper in it.  

I'd give these folks 3 stars for being A-OK. One extra star for not charging for the returned calzone. I'm going to give this place another shot later and see if I get something I really and truly enjoy to make it a solid 4 or maybe a 5. I really want to like this place. Everything about it should really register with me. Local - Organic - other Yelpers seem to like it. Not sure why the Calzone's just did not do it for me.",01-03-2020 04:35,1

Although I lived in Italy for over 5 years in 2 different regions, I don't consider myself an Italian food purist.  I think Italian food could evolve and some substitutes could taste better than the original thing,  However, this place took too many liberties.  Squid ink pasta shouldn't be doused in a cream.  Olive oil or perhaps cooked in seafood stock would be sufficient.  The spaghetti frutta di mare was ok.  Again I felt like I was eating cioppino that happened to have some pasta.  If it didn't have the pasta bit, it would be good seafood stew. The crostata was made out of a pre-fabricated mold, pasted with Nutella and berry fruits on top.  Not exactly what one should get when one advertises a fruit crostata.  I could make this at home.  When I go out to a place and order something unique, it's because I can't make it at home.  The pros:  extensive wine list; pizza dough was legit; calamari fritti; and grilled branzino.  We have had the bonet cake and tiramisu here for dessert and they were good.

This sweet girl, Michelle*, working behind the bar had asked how they were enjoying everything and the man simply replied ""it could have been better."" So when she* asked if he would like to try something else or to be compensated, the man became very irritated and said he did not want to be comped for his meal, just that he was being honest about not liking his food and then told her to quit being so upset. Then his wife started yelling across the bar while the bartender was clearly helping another guest. These two were very condescending and rude to the staff, and there was just no pleasing them.

Been by here so many times. After all it Is in the heart of downtown. I just never stopped by. That changed today. 

Looked over the menu. They have a selection of pies many vegetables no meat but customizable with meats etc that can be added to make your pie yours.  On the website they boast of an ever popular ""elote"" pizza. A Unique combo to say the least, it has Roasted Corn, Cotija Cheese, Fresh Cilantro & Chipotle.  Not being sure what to make of it, of course I had to order it to try it. 

What a pleasant surprise. the pizza is not overly corn sweet. It's more of a pleasant corn flavor coupled with a slight tang. A tasty flavorful bite. It's totally enjoyable. Totally southwestern. 

We also ordered the Mulberry St. more on the traditional side this pizza has 
Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Green Pepper, Onion, Mushrooms

Both pizzas had a wonderful perfect crust. The ingredients were obviously fresh, perfectly balanced with just the right amount of cheese and both were a wonderful dinner.

The pies are 20"" large. Perfect for any occasion. We totally enjoyed it. A couple of us had seconds. Due to the generous size of these pies there still was a small amount of extra slices. Perfect for tomorrow s lunch. 

Btw if it's just you or everyone wants something different they also have slices. Pick one or Many, it's a great way to try everything. 

The menu also consists of wings, salads, canned sodas, bottled Mexican sodas including Fanta, water etc. 

They also have a varied and generous dessert menu. Dessert consists of 
Pana Cotta, Cannoli, Deep Fried Cinnamon Rolls,  New York Cheesecake, and Tiramisu. 

I'm sure virtually anyone can find a favorite item,  no, not item. But rather items to enjoy.

I was born and raised in Manhattan, and Little Italy was a stone's throw from my neighborhood. This pizza is seriously good, sorry Magpies, not quite NY-style, but really, supersonically good on its own merits. 

I work for an academic institution in town, and we've had several events here. Sue, the manager, has been a-ma-zing each and every time Magpies has hosted our events. Once, I (silly me) even managed to reserve Magpies the day before the 4th Avenue Festival, but Sue and her staff were still attentive and wonderful.

How did Magpies become our local pizzeria of choice? A number of reasons:

1. They cater to everyone with dietary needs/allergies. When coordinating an event (groups numbering from 24-60), there are a dizzying amount of culinary challenges: 

Vegan/dairy-free pizza? Check! P.S. I'd never had vegan cheese, I figured it was a slimy stepchild of real cheese. It's not. Daiya mozzarella rocks on pizza. I now buy Daiya thanks to Magpies. My vegans were impressed.

Gluten-free pizza? Check! It's a cauliflower-based crust, nothing like the gluten-free bread my honey once brought home which made me question our relationship (j.k.). With a slight crisp and a delish flavor, I thought it was great and my gluten-free attendees were pleased.

2. Excellent service with a smile. Changing menus due to the fluctuating number of attendees, moving us outside on a lovely day, reconfiguring seating when more people arrive, hanging our banner, all were accomplished/anticipated professionally and cordially. The customer service extends to the cooks as well. As stress-free of an experience as possible.

What have we had? White pie, seven cheese, pesto, chicken pesto, the beast, pepperoni, veggie, and custom. 

Lastly, I found Magpies after a horrible experience with another business that shall remain nameless. I knew I needed to find a place with great food and service. Seven events and orders later, we've found our pizza home. Thank you Sue and thanks Magpies staff.",03-01-2020 06:51,1

There are usually five or six other people waiting for their take out orders as well, plus dine-in customers.  Somewhat defeats the purpose of ordering take out in order to social distance.  But I digress.

On my most recent visit, I ordered at 5:10 and was told ""45 minutes"".  I showed up at 6:05 and was told ""10 more minutes"".  At 6:20 I was given my pizza and an extra slice that I did not order, with zero explanation.  When I checked to make sure it was the pizza I ordered, I found that a big chunk of the pizza was missing (hence the extra slice).  Again, no explanation, no mention that part of my pizza was missing.  I asked the team of teenagers what happened, and was told it ripped when they were taking it out of the oven.

I've worked in restaurants...accidents happen, kitchens get behind on orders, food comes out late or not as ordered.  I get it.  But at Mama's it seems to be the rule and not the exception.  I could maybe look past it if there was ever an inkling of contrition.  ""Hey, sorry your pizza is 30 minutes late"" or ""we accidentally ripped a hole in your pizza, so here's an extra slice.""  At Mama's I don't think I've ever even heard the words ""thank you"".

I'm done with this place.",03-06-2021 01:18,0

Yes, I believe all of it, but that doesn't stop me from getting the best pizza in the city. It is one of those places where you have to know what to expect before you come. Call in your order (they don't deliver), but don't ask too many questions because the person at the other end invariably does not want to talk to you. Their menu is online and there are never specials beyond what is on there for lunch. Show up at least 10 minutes beyond the time they tell you it will take and don't be surprised if it's still not ready.

Old review from 2 years before...- Mario's is hands down the best pizza in town. And I grew up in the NYC metro area. And that includes New Haven, CT.

Our pizza was dough was RAW in the middle. We called to see if we could take the food back, and get a refund. The lady who answered was extremely rude off the bat; told us there was nothing she could do because we had ordered through a third-party (which they provide.) She said she did not recommend ordering through the third-party, and told us we needed to call next time to order. Understandable, but this is a service that you provide to your customers and if you do not recommend it, I do not understand why you guys are even in a contract with them. We called Slice to get our money back, and they told us the restaurant was not approving the refund because to them the order was made ""correctly."" Called back again just to receive a bunch of attitude by a girl, then yelling to I'm assuming the owner's wife, on how to handle the situation. They called me a ""b*tch"", told me I was making it up, and then just hung up on me. Called AGAIN the next day to talk to the owner and he rudely interrupted me and told me he could not do anything because it was through a third-party and hung up on me again.

While we were looking at the menu I was jazzed about the idea of a future pie from a certified Neapolitano pizzeria, but after eating the food, we felt like there was no point in ordering a pie if they're as unconcerned with the quality of the pizza as they are with the rest of the food on the menu, and the diners' experiences.

We went to my house, opened the pizza, and we had the complete wrong order. We took it back, and apparently it had been another customers order who was there ever since we had left. We explained everything to the person that helped us and he decided to give both of us free cookies for the inconvenience, the person came out with a cookie for the other customer, and was going to give him the food we brought back. It was very cold by then and the employee gave the guy sass about it when he asked him to remake it. Little to mention the other customer had his pregnant wife in the car the entire time. After that, another employee came to give us refunds on our orders because of this, which I haven't received still a day later (I'm still hoping that comes in). 

About an hour after the original pick up time happened our food was brought out by the original guy. I asked to make sure everything was there and gave me a sassy ""yeah you can check it if you want"", which I did and sure enough, he forgot the wings we ordered as well. The was no way in hell the employee that served us was sober, I wish I got his name to report, but I didn't. There needs to be drug tests happening cause I'm not sure if anyone working there was sober either. The employee that served us and messed up absolutely every thing he could have was on the larger side, and had one headphone in the entire time. 

This was by far the worst customer service I had ever had anywhere, and the employee that served us doesn't deserve to have a job. I will never be going to this location again, and I'm sure everyone else that ordered food that night won't either.

No atmosphere to speak of- just a few long picnic-type tables with bench seating. Not an issue, though, as you'll probably order to go.

They make New York style (thin crust) pizzas. You pick up a slice, fold it in half lengthwise and eat out of hand. Service is a little slow, but the pizza quality makes up for it.
They have several sizes, including the largest, which is fit for a family. Two of us couldn't finish it; had to save it over to morning (breakfast).

Also, sides are ala carte, so your tasteless burger doesn't even come with it's good 'old side kick- fries! When I go to a place like Divine Bovine for a burger and I have to order ala carte it's no big deal, because 1) their burgers are in fact divine, and stand alone in flavor and satisfaction and 2) their sides are substantial and shareable. Brooklyn's side of fries- maybe a handful oh and they were not hot nor crispy.  Then the service ISNA whole other story... Basically as i previously stated its a place to drink, not eat.

I'd heard a lot of great things about it in a Facebook group and thought it would be worth a try next time I was on the east side of town. The young woman at the counter was great - friendly, fun, efficient. I ordered a slice to go. Like most pizza places here, the ""slice"" was about 18"" long. Why don't pizza places sell regular large-sized slices? They're so much easier all around. 
After waiting about 10 minutes, a surly little character called out that the order was ready. He put the slice across two paper plates and slid it into a paper bag. I asked if he could put a piece of foil on it and he said ""we don't give out foil."" I thought he was kidding, but he was serious. ""The owner says we don't give out foil."" When I said that they weren't making a very good first impression, he said "" we've been doing it this way since 1974."" I have to imagine they're still using rotary dial phones, too. Then he sealed the paper bag with a piece of masking tape. And I have to admit, the last time I saw a piece of masking tape was probably back in 1974. 
At any rate, by the time I got home, the pizza was cold. I popped it into the oven to warm it up, but that didn't help much. It tasted kind of ... meh. 
The crust tasted doughy and non-descript. The toppings of italian sausage and canned mushrooms were fine (I prefer canned mushrooms on pizza), the sauce was middle of the road and there was very little cheese. Over all, it was a little better than what I remember of Little Caesars. I get the feeling that cutting costs is the owner's prime directive.

This had me thinking, ""Would they skimp on quality due to the low cost?"". From the looks of our order today, it looks like they did. 

Our pizza was, by far, the worst pie we had ever gotten from Mama's. The pizza was bland. It was missing their signature Italian/oregano seasoning. The cheese tasted like a lower quality cheese. They gave us less pepperoni than usual and the crust was just not right, bland.

The wings were as usual which came with a side of ranch. When we received our order outside, due to curb-side pick-up, I asked the employee of the ranch was packed with the wings. He responded with, ""it should be"". It was not, it was blue cheese. We did not notice this until we were home and had started eating.

No burger could be found. So I feel that based on this experience, their TV commercials are total BS.  As for courteous and caring staff. Total BS. Will not be going back ever. To many much better places around town. And if Dominos needs the money that bad that they dong give you your change, they should ask. Just like the TV commercial, the guy threw the pizza into the cart. Thanks but I can do much better.",10/24/2020 2:15,0

My food was excellent and well thought out.

My Quattro Formaggio had changed from what it used to be but was very good. The final food item was my glass of wine or two.

This place feels like a classic sports bar, but has a much better selection of draft beers. One of the current specialty beers they offered had an incredibly steep mark-up though. They charged $15 for a pint, which is the cost of a 6-pack at Total Wine. I understand that mark-up is important in retail and restaurants, but that was overkill. 

The food had a decent price, was really filling, but there were a few quality issues. I ordered the New Mexico burger and the garlic aioli sauce was a really heavy-handed and pretty much existed on only one side of the burger. My husband also also a burger at medium temperature and it came out more well-done than mine. To be fair, I'm sure they would've recooked another one, but we just didn't have a lot of time to wait for it. 

The best part of the trip was the speed and quality of service we received. The waitstaff was really friendly and attentive. I would probably be willing to try this place again, but would just avoid the ""specialty beers"" that were currently being offered.",1/17/2021 20:42,1

The service is slow and cold.  Not rude, but not exactly nice, either.  Getting a drink refill was like pulling teeth.

Ok, I guess I don't need much attention anyway, but it would be nice.

The food is fine, but it doesn't blow me away in the least.  I've tried something different each time to see if it was just a dud dish that I ordered, and I don't think so.  The sauce was very basic and not very exciting in every dish that had a sauce.  The tomato sauce on the pasta was watery once, even.  That's just not correct.  The pizza dough was somewhat bland, but cooked nicely.  The ovens here are good.  The portions are quite small for the pricing.  I generally don't mind that, but the food has to be super, or at least really good, and it's not.

At first, I thought it was great because of the huge size of the slices of pizza you got here. I then later started realizing that the pizza itself wasn't very good. Then I started seeing that the prices were just plain high for pizza and Italian food. The last couple years I've gone, it has been on Saturday nights. Each time they didn't have a pizza ready to serve slices. That seems like pretty poor management skills, considering more people eat pizza on the weekends, so they should be prepared for that. Then comes the amount of time it takes to cook a pizza there. If they put the pizza in the oven right then, to make one for slices, they say it will take 50 minutes. I've never seen any pizza place take that long to cook a pizza. Any restaurant to cook anything really. This time I ordered a calzone because they said it would only take 25 to 30 minutes. Still quite a long time. That and it was 19.95 for a large calzone and that's just with the bare minimum. Just a cheese calzone. 1 dollar per each additional topping. Again, the quality was lacking also. I wanted so badly for this place to be good, but the simple truth is, its low quality at a high price.

My salad was good. The vinegarette was ok but I think it needed a bit more flavor. Salt and pepper helped. And a tad more avocado wouldn't hurt.
I like this place. It's comfortable,  bright, clean , lots of variety on their menu and friendly employees.

I started panicking and the tech pulled me out. We tried again, but this time it was worse. She recommended finding an open MRI place and asking for a new referral to one of those locations. A quick Google search pulled up Advanced Open MRI of Tucson. 

I got all the needed calls made and referral was good to go. I spoke with Adam by phone and he was reassuring that once my appointment time came, I would be fine. He also assured me I could go in feet first and I appreciated that. 

On my appointment day, it was Adam who would be doing the scans. He was again reassuring that everything would be fine and checked on me immediately following each scan. The fact I could turn my head side to side was also a big help. I'd looked online and wasn't sure even open MRI would be for me because in the other one, but turning my head made all the difference seeing it was open. He played music of my choice and it's obvious he genuinely tries to make the patient comfortable. 

I was given a disc of the images and sent on my way. I highly recommend this place to anyone at all who suffers from claustrophobia and needs an MRI.

I wasnt feeling overly hungry so I ordered an appetizer as my entree, Burrata with extra crostini's which is fresh mozzarella, pesto, balsamic vinegar and tomato and I must say , after this meal I would class this as the best Italian food in Tucson.

I think their highest points are the pizza (pepperoni mushroom was great) and the tiramisu. The crust is slightly crisp and nicely chewy. 

Pasta here is a bit less exciting. Of course it's a mass manufactured noodle (the corkscrew one, my favorite), and the basic tomato one isn't very saucy and is a bit watery and bland. Mac and cheese is good, but I'd add a meat topping to it to get more flavor. (Also, a side of their pasta is HUGE.)

The restaurant had a nice, clean appearance. We were seated quickly and our orders taken. I ordered the made from scratch lasagna and my fiancee opted for the roasted salmon. I was hoping that the dinners might come with a salad or at least some bread, which almost every Italian restaurant I have been to includes, but neither arrived at our table and our server never mentioned this. For the prices of these dishes, it was surprising and disappointing.

Further disappointment awaited us when the entrees arrived. My lasagna was lukewarm, but I was hungry at that point and opted not to send it back. While the taste was reasonably good, I was surprised how small the portion was. I am used to lasagna being a large, filling dish that typically requires a take home container. Not this time! In fact, after I finished eating this paltry offering, I was still hungry and ended up having to get a snack elsewhere. My fiancee's salmon was nothing to write home about either. She said it tasted like something she had never eaten before, and that was not a good thing.

The appetizers are great and there's a wonderful selection, but that's where it ends. The pastas, salads, and pizzas - which dominate the menu - are all very similar. They usually offer only two types of noodle - linguine or penne - the two most boring noodles in the pasta world. I think there's one dish that offers farfalle (bowtie) but most all the pasta dishes are far too similar for a restaurant this good.

I was going to let this go, but the owner/manager/someone (close-cropped white hair) came out to try to yell at me after we had a bad experience and expressed it in the tip. I wish I heard him, he clearly was angry, but when I rolled down the window and asked if he had something to say, he barked, ""NO!"" and then said something else as I turned north on to Swan. For the first time in my life I left no tip (our order was wrong, but the restaurant did the right thing- they credited us the cost of the incorrect dish, which was a great gesture...so why 1 star? Read on.)
My food was cold because they screwed up on her order- it's not a great idea for a restaurant to offer two dishes with the same name. When her Mediterranean pizza (which she ordered by pointing to) showed up as a bowl of pasta, we were surprised. They fixed the error, and credited us for the mistake which was a baller move...A+ for that, and I would've rated 5 stars if that was the end of it (the food, while cold, since mine sat, was tasty). I would've preferred that they took my food back too, even if it meant time on the holding station- at least it would've been warm.
The right dish was served, and we finally ate our meals, but when I asked for the check, our server took my card and disappeared. 20-30 minutes later, I decided to hunt her down- wasn't hard, she was behind the bar, talking to another couple, not doing anything. When I managed to catch her attention, she expressed great surprise,  which confirms for me that she forgot about us. 

She handed me the wrong folio, and she had to scramble to find the right one, which another patron inside the bar pointed out (somehow). We'd been here for 1.5 hours, for a pizza and salad with a sandwich.  

One Star: The fact that I had to hunt down out server to leave, and used the tip for what it's intended to do to express my frustration is NOT why I'm posting. As I'm driving away, Senior White Hair lunges out of the back. Is our server his daughter? I don't care she was off her game. 

I know the customer is not always right, but when I'm accosted by someone, even if I didn't hear his delightful barbs because my window was closed, after I had to locate his hired staff, I'm not coming back. Fuck this place.",3/16/2021 3:50,0

1) My (now) husband and I had our rehearsal dinner for our wedding on their cozy, clean, lovely patio. It was set up so nicely and everything was just perfect. Getting it all arranged ahead of time couldn't have been easier either!

2) The Staff, especially the manager, Brent, were friendly, attentive, and communicative. Our servers were absolutely awesome. They gave us great care and had an amazing attitude. Happy and welcoming! It felt like we were all just hanging out at a friend's place. We discussed the food, the history of the restaurant (like the original brick from Italy), and how long the restaurant had been there. It was just overall enjoyable!

2) The Food here is AMAZING! We had lasagna and roasted garlic pasta, which was absolute perfection. There were also beautiful salads, that were fresh, with the most delicious dressings and tasty bread to accompany!

4 of us - sitting in the closest booth to the pizza maker and none of us heard it. 
Won't go back. 

Also: Nobody took responsibility tonight - I head them call 'James' 3x.  Maybe they got the name wrong?
They didn't seem to care about the service. Offered to remake it - but that would take too long now. So, we asked them to put the cold pizza in a box and we'd take it home.

Standing near computer, chatting with each other, sipping sodas. After at least 15 minutes a server came over.

Today I went and all in all they bumped up a star, but still far from my 5 star rating three years ago. Still sat at the bar for 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged my existence. Finally, what appeared to be the only waiter working (only two tables and I at the bar) came out from the back and saw me. I order a FireTruck Icebreak IPA (I was happy they have it on tap, as FireTruck Brewing hasn't had it on tap in over a month). Unfortunately, the beer was kind flat (later another employee came to check the CO2 and said it was full and good to go). BTW the second beer was just as flat, and the waiter even noticed. They must be having issues with their system. I ordered an Italian Stallion sandwich with the Caesar Salad. The salad came out in a reasonable amount of time. However, I finished my salad and a beer and waited for another 8 minutes before the waiter came by and asked if I wanted a refill. I said yes. I waited another 5 minutes to get my sandwich. In the mean time a group of customers who came in well after I did was served their pizzas. Why does it take so long to get a sandwich? Once the sandwich came out it was very tasty. Overall, the service still lacks in attentiveness, beer was FLAT, and the food was good. I have increased their rating to 3 stars. Still lots of work to be done to get back to my original 5 stars.",8/24/2021 23:32,0

She told us that Empire Pizza was founded on their Elote slices as their flagship differentiator. Yes, they still have boring cheese slices and regular pepperoni slices also - which to be fair, looked super tasty - but if you pass by, grab you a slice of their unique Elote pizza. SO GOOD.

The lady helping us said she made the chipotle drizzle that goes on top and also hit the slice with a little Tajìn sprinkle and cilantro. So unique and SO flavorful.

Decent prices are also found here. $3 for cheese, $3.50 for pepp, and $4.25 for the Elote, per slice. The slices are also HUGE! If you find my photo, she cut my large slice in two so I could share with my wife. These big slices overtake a whole paper plate!

Anello serves a small menu but don't let that fool you! They offer three staple pizzas with a rotating pizza option as well as a rotating veg option and dessert. Although some may look at their menu and think that the pizzas are pricey, it's all worth it for the quality of the pizza and ingredients. You can't go wrong with a margarita pizza, but I definitely would recommend trying their Verde pizza since it's unique with pine nuts and this green sauce drizzled on top.

They have a few options for appetizers including the veggie options, but I highly recommend ordering the focaccia with ricotta. It is delicious! If you want to indulge, order one for yourself, but if you're with a small group, it's a great little bite to start your night off. When I came here for the first time with my roommates, we ordered the focaccia, one veg option, and all four pizzas: the main staples plus their rotating pizza. We did it family style, pre-pandemic, and it was a great opportunity to taste a little off everything on their menu.

During Covid, the restaurant has remained closed to dine in eating. All of their food can be purchased and ordered online with a chosen pick up time. It's a great option for those of us still wanting to taste their delicious pizza during this pandemic! The only downside is that they don't have a phone number you can contact them by. You have to either order online or contact them by email.

Definitely remember to support local and order some pizza from Anello!",10/22/2020 15:00,1

I really enjoy the avocado egg rolls, and the Margherita flatbread.    The Chicken Tortilla soup is pretty good too. They add corn and  diced tomatoes , and that really adds a unique flavor.

My husband's pizza is as great.  A softer crust and a tasty sauce and yummy toppings.
No room for dessert anywhere, as we had ordered two rounds of drinks (wine comes in 6 oz and 9 oz pours).  We were so happy, though.

These rectangular pizzas come in one size and are cut into four smaller rectangles, roughly 6x5 inches each.  For $20, I have to agree with others, that it's just a bit overpriced for the size. The prosciutto was also too salty even for prosciutto.  The crunchy/buttery crust, sauce, and cheese were excellent though.

I explained what was wrong, and she offered to have the kitchen remake my entree.   It took well over 20 minutes to bring me a properly prepared order.  During this time there was no offer to bring me anything while I waited.  By the time the replacement order came, the other two members of my party were finished eating. 

While I  waited, another employee  commented how the entree should never have been served that way, and because I'd been there before (I hadn't) I should have known how it was usually served.  Regardless of her incorrect assumptions, I was presented with nearly inedible food. The server did nothing to make the long wait less irritating, and the editorial comment from the other employee was presumptuous and off-putting.

Personally, I think this business model for Tucson is sensational!!! In fact, it was so busy there we had to circle a few times to find a parking spot. We called the eatery and the women said there was at least an hour wait to be seated. She however, neglected to say they have a fantastic open window bar, essentially an open tap area to their phenomenal outdoor seating sections and games. In retrospect, I'm glad we decided to just walk in, instead of drive elsewhere. This made it really easy to order our drinks and immediately start playing cornhole! I was floored by the amount of chairs and sections outside and the number of games! As I was playing connect-four, I was literally planning my next dinner party there. After chatting for 90 minutes, and enjoying multiple drinks, we put our name in to eat. Only, 15 minutes later, our party of six was seated inside and our server was FANTASTIC. He was hilarious, knowledgeable, and experienced! I asked him everything about the business and future plans and the conversation was great! And most importantly, the food was DELICIOUS.

Ambiance - Few seating available, but it was a very intimate and romantic setting. There was only one server and one cook, but it was cool to see them actually make everything and put the pizza in the pizza oven. Parking was a pain though which is the only downside. You can hangout at the brewery next door if you're waiting for a seat.

Service - Efficient and helpful! Never too overbearing and their attention to water was great, because we were very dehydrated and going through water super fast.

Food - Limited menu, but sometimes those are the best bc you know everything on the menu is going to be good.
§ Special pizza of the day was with white sauce, sweet red bell peppers, and fennel on top. It was a very interesting combination of flavors that was well rounded and brought together with a bit of lime juice on top.

This review is for the North location. 
The first time we tried to come here (5:30pm on a Friday), we were turned away at the door. The two young gals behind the desk told us they had ""too many reservations so we can't seat you"". Like, at all?? Not even a wait time, just no. I then asked if the bar was open seating and was told ""yea, but we're still too busy"". But then they told us we could go next door to Tap & Bottle and order food TO GO and eat it over there. Soooo you're too busy to serve us at all but we can order take out and eat it somewhere else? So weird. Bad service. 

We gave it another shot and made a reservation this time. The reservation was for 5:00 - well they don't open until 5 so when I got there a few minutes early the doors were locked and we had to wait outside. Not thrilled about waiting outside in the heat but there were several parties of really old folks that I felt bad for having to stand there and wait while the hostesses stared at us through the glass. No benches or seating to sit on to wait. 

The menu is small and boring. They have a small drink menu and all of their beers are in CANS! Nothing on tap. I ordered a Caesar salad and the meatball pizza. The salad was bland and just ok. It was a good size but not worth the $12 for a plain Caesar salad - no tomato, no croutons, nothing special. Just lettuce and dressing. The pizza crust bottom was thin and floppy and the meatballs were awful. They were spongy and mushy and tasted like fake meat. I'd be shocked if they were real meat. They sauce was actually really good. Had a good balance of sweetness and acidity and wasn't overly seasoned. This pizza is $19 on the menu - but because I asked for normal pizza cheese on top I got charged $3 more dollars. $22 for a pizza that is mediocre at best was disappointing. 

The service was really good. The girl that took care of us was attentive and very sweet and had an outgoing personality. 

One thing I appreciated is that this is a SIT DOWN restaurant. It seems like all of the new restaurants in OV  lately are 'order at the counter and be herded like cattle', so this is a nice option if you're looking for a sit down place with service. 

Overall, just meh. I definitely won't hurry back here but I'm glad I tried it.",8/21/2021 17:46,0

Regret that I was not able to capitalize on visiting this beautiful place more frequently in the 5 years I have lived here. 

Anello, started by I believe one of the chefs who worked with Chris Bianco of Pizzeria Bianco, is everything I personally look for in a hip, modern restaurant. They embody an ethos of minimalism and focus on quality, as evident from the beautiful wooden tables and benches, and a focused and concise menu with emphasis on quality locally-sourced ingredients. Oh, and did I mention their menu features natural wine? (those who know me know my fondness of natural wine). After 2 visits, I think I've already tasted most of their menu at least once. Of all the pizzas, my personal favorites would be the bianca (white pizza with very garlic-forward profile) and margherita (a classic). I would also recommend ordering the seasonal veggies and focaccia/ricotta, and if your budget allows, their daily salads have been excellent on both occasions as well. Honestly, I've pretty much just named their whole menu, so as you can tell I was a big fan. Definitely the best pizza in Tucson in my opinion, please go check them out if you haven't already and support local! (Oh and during COVID, they do take to-go orders!)  

Tip: (for when COVID blows over...) they do not have a phone number, and only take reservations for larger parties by email, so be sure to get their early unless you don't mind waiting, as their seating is on the limited side (which is not the worst, with Crooked Tooth next door).",04-08-2020 01:56,1

They need to stop advertising real Italian as it is inauthentic Italian food. The Bruschetta lacked flavor, the bread was not crispy and tasted like it had been sitting out on a patio while it rained for two days. I want to describe the soup but I can't. And I can't because I'm not really sure what it was. Two bites Into the entrée I realized we should've went to Chick-fil-A for real chicken. The chicken breast was actually rib meat glued together, slathered in what looked like house special egg foo yung sauce. While I understand Olive Garden is not real authentic Italian food, I gladly would have paid their prices instead of the overpriced meal that we paid for here. The food is bland and tasteless which is going to end up in the trash because not even my dog will eat it. The chicken piccata tasted like lemon. None of the food we received was hot. We're still trying to understand why we waited so long when they were four people in there and two of them left once we sat down. 

We probably should've known when we walked in and there were four people total in the restaurant. Service was slow. Couldn't remember what each of us ordered in a party of two.

The price is reasonable. Sodas are $2.50. They charge $.50 for sides, like ranch. Generous inside and outside seating. Small bar, and certainly tables in the bar area have a Super Nintendo hooked up for free game play. Building is open and clean. 

The only con is that you cannot modify the toppings on their preselected pizzas. You also can't build your own. I believe this is because the pizzas are precooked.

After 3 increasingly poor experiences here, myself and 8 other nearby residents will not be returning or recommending this place. In this most recent experience our party of 9 received 8 meals together and the last one  over 20 mins later. Clearly disappointing for all the reasons you would expect... meals got cold while we waited, it's was unclear when this final meal was coming out despite asking multiple times and this individual inevitably ate alone. Regardless of what happened to that meal it was a service/restaurant error and it really soured our dining experience. As a seemingly reasonable ask we cordially requested that meal be removed from the tab. We were instead given $2 off. I was quite taken back as our ask was not unreasonable and it would have been practically unnoticeable on a 9 person tab for dinner and drinks. Still cordial we asked our pleasant server to grab a manager. Payton greeted our table with an eye roll, attitude and appalling customer service skills.

Not one sorry, ever. Snide, rude and was insistent that yes the delivery was delivered.
It was very obviously delivered to the wrong house (if actually delivered at all). That's not my problem, that's the businesses problem. They said they would send out another delivery. It's been about an hour and still haven't received it and have have a feeling that we won't.

I also had a southwest salad and it was yummy, yummy. Generous amount of dressing on the top too! I thought there could have been a tad more avocado and I do admit it was a pricy $15 salad but it was good. It was crisp. Nice amount of chicken. Pleased, overall.

So I go online and look up the menu. Their menu online is woefully inadequate! I asked to order lasagna and shrimp scampi. They don't have lasagna so the bar tender reccomended something else similar, good.  She said 45 minutes.  I got there right about 5 min late.  I went to the bar, as instructed. She said my order wasn't ready. 20 minutes later she says that they must have given my order to someone in house. She's very sorry. So, about 30 minutes later she comes back with a bag of food, i payed, and left. When I got home, we opened the bag, took out the food, and one of the little boxes had 4 small congealed shrimp. When I called them back, the same bartender answered. She said that shrimp scampi was an appetizer. WHAT!? I PAID $9.99 FOR 4 COLD, OLD, SHRIMP?! AND I WAITED 2 HOURS FOR IT?!

The burgers were excellent and very juicy and tasty, the service was good too.

We tried the prickly pear margarita and the hummus board while we observed all the fun stuff to do, such as corn toss.

Pros:
All the staff were very friendly and fairly attentive. Additionally this seemed like a neighborhood establishment where many patrons seems to be 'regulars'. Overall a very nice atmosphere.

The bruschetta appetizer was very good.

They have a very nice patio with a great view of the Catalina Mountains. It was very hot when we dined, so we ate inside. We might go back when it is cooler to sit outside.

The entrees were good. Not the best we ever had, but good nonetheless.

The portions were huge.  Way too large for us but we took the leftovers home.

The overall cost was relatively inexpensive. 

Cons:
The bread served before the meal (baked garlic knots) was cold and simply uneatable. They would be much better off purchasing baguettes from a local bakery and serving sliced bread with butter or olive oil.

There were a few items on their menu they no longer serve (calamari, shrimp cocktail).

The menu also stated that our entrees would be served with ""home made"" pasta. The pasta was ok but there is no way, no way at all, it was ""home made"". It was standard domestic dried pasta. Although not bad, I purchase much better pasta for our own cooking at home.

We requested some Parmesan cheese on the side for our entries. The server provided a very small ramkin (maybe 1 or 2 ounce rankin usually used for ketchup or mayo), with poorer quality shaved Parmesan cheese.  Shaved parmesan is ok on a salad, but for an entree, they should really provided a decent grated Parmesan.

Summary:
This is a nice place but they need to address their weaknesses (bread, pasta, updated menus etc).",6/15/2020 23:57,0

The garlic knots were incredible as always. The live music is SO WONDERFUL! Although, I wonder if there could be an option to leave a tip on the card for the musician as well. I would love to tip the entertainment but I don't always have cash.

This time we were adventurous and tried totally new dishes! 

We enjoyed the Caprese Salad as an appetizer, crisp tomatoes, delicious cheese, fresh basil. The only down side - I would have liked a cracker to go with it. 

As entrees we enjoyed Dominick's Lasagna and Primavera Con Pesto. As side soups we had Clam Chowder and Chili. The lasagna was standard good. The Primavera Con Pesto included fresh tasting ingredients and was very flavorful - I would suggest adding the chicken. Upon a reorder I would add the chicken.

For great food, great ambiance, and great service, and I'm happy to say that Barnyard Crafthouse has a five star rating for all three categories! 

Let's talk about ambience. I loved the country style Americana, Yankee-barn home-esque vibe they had with their decor. There were a ton of windows letting in a lot of natural light and kept the heat out at the same time. Overall their decor was created a pleasant, relaxing experience. 

Their service was outstanding. I can't say enough good things about it. Our waiter was warm and friendly, helpful and attentive. I wish I could remember his name but he was phenomenal.

We were then told that we would need to order from the bar even though other tables were being served by waiters. We said that was fine and asked for menus. I noticed she went out the courtyard and checked our Jeep for a handicap plate after providing us menus. 

After we perused the menu I went to the bar to place my order. I was ignored for 15 minutes while both bartenders walked past me not even acknowledging my presence despite my initiating a greeting. It was not busy so there was no reason to be continuously passed by and ignored. We decided to leave and honestly we should have left after the initial interaction.

We had actually eaten a few hours before but it was a bit early for us to head home and we wanted a cool drink and maybe dessert.
We were seated quickly and our server was friendly. 
My guy found something that caught his eye, two scoops of vanilla ice cream and I ordered the mini pizzokie ( includes a scoop of ice cream). Our server let me know the regular size was one of the specials that day ( Tuesday) and a better deal. Why not? I figured my guy and I would share the  pizzokie.
After sipping on a good old Dr. Pepper and some good conversation,  our desserts came out.
That chocolate chip pizzokie was warm and the chocolate was a  melty, gooey delicious. tastey treat. And that ice cream ? Yumm Those scoops had slivers of vanilla bean and was rich and smooth. Read the menu again and found out it's Ghirardelli brand. Guess we have a favorite new brand to look out for in the market.

The food was delicious and the waiter was awesome, but the manager was nothing short of rude. I have a food allergy, I read the menu. I informed my waiter had him check the ingredients on a few things and then ordered. My good came and it was delicious, as I was eating I saw tomatoes, my allergy in my good. I flagged the waiter down immediately and was very helpful and apologetic. I ordered something else and thought I was in the clear because I didn't think I ate any. 20 minutes later I asked for the manager to find out how much I might have ingested. It turns out the tomatoes were in the cheese sauce which the manager assured me they weren't. He then brought me the menu to read what I ordered . Basically telling me the nachos didn't have tomatoes and I made it up. He then told me that if I am allergic to tomatoes this probably isn't the place for me to eat.  continued to berate me. Now luckily my allergy is not life threatening but can you imagine if it was?  I have a 5 year old with 4 life threatening food allergies and I would never trust such a disrespectful manager to over see his meal.

And it had a generous amount of toppings. What I really liked about this pizza was the heft. Each slice was heavy and substantial. It was also delicious. The staff was super nice and friendly. And brought it out to our car when we arrived as we could only do take out due to the lock down. We will definitely be giving this place a try again. It wasn't the cheapest pizza place in town.

They are ignored and disrespected when they arrive to deliver this restaurants food.


Great job GM.  

I think it's funny how BJ's can treat drivers less than customers.  I represent someone who bought food from your store.  Maybe instead of thanking me for my comment, you should have found a solution.  Maybe even sought a process improvement.  I go to your restaurant multiple times a week.  I doubt anything will change, but don't be surprised when drivers give you the same level of respect.

What looked like a nice patio area too. The menu was long and full of a pretty big diversity of foods. It can be a little misleading though. I saw for 10.99 that I could order a full serving of chicken wings. I asked the bartender how many wings were in a full serving. 7! That may be a full serving to some people, but I was thinking more around a dozen. Especially for that price. For 20 bucks you could order a double serving, and that was 14 wings. So their prices were my only problem. The wings I did get were quality wings and very well prepared. Everything that was ordered at my table was very well made and delicious. That definitely shows why things costed more. Service was good and the overall experience was good. Alot better food than I would have expected in the sports bar section of a restaurant.

They have room for improvement in some areas but not enough to change my rating. So, read on to learn about how they are taking orders during Covid-19.

Anello will be remain closed for dine-in services despite the state opening back up on May 16th. They will continue to do take-out/pick up only,12p-8pm tues-sat

How to order: They do not have a phone that you can call it. You must order online only. You can try emailing them is something is super pressing, but I recommend just sticking to takeout. You will be able to select the time to pick-up. Customers cannot go inside the shop. There is a table at the entrance where you can check-in. If your pizza is ready, they will hand it to you and you're all set! You pay and tip online so it's essentially contact-free! Please tip the staff! The check-in staff wore masks as well.

Being a native Tucsonan, I don't know if this pizza was authentic Detroit style, but it was tasty. We ordered the Parmesan fries and buffalo pizza. The fries came out first, and had shredded Parmesan on top with two different dipping sauces. The pizza sauce was on the sweeter side and the crust was soft and melted with every bite. Each pizza is around $20 and comes with 4 square pieces. If you're hungry, I would not recommend sharing.",10-03-2021 18:50,1

Pizza - crispy crust and delicious toppings . You can split the pizza and try two different styles from the menu . Our favorite is the pepperoni and the prosciutto and arugula (not pictured) 
Fries - the fries came out with a mountain of cheese and were hot and tasty . It was nice to have a appetizer that came out before the pizza . Kids killed the fries . 
Kids menu - there is no kids menu. But you can order a pepperoni pizza off the menu sans the chili peppers.",11/14/2021 3:47,1

LOL  Was I at a dance club or or a restaurant?  My boyfriend and I went on a lunch date (together).  He ordered the Elote Pizza, and I went for the Italian Sandwich and Garlic Parmesan Fries.  We both ordered a drink.  I'm only giving them one star because the Elote Pizza was great.  The overall experience was TERRIBLE.

Asked the server if hot or cold was better, she said HOT.  He got his Elote Pizza first, 5 minutes later we got our Parmesan Fries, and about 5 min after that I got my sandwich.  We arrived together, but ate separately.

When I got my sandwich it was COLD.  I confirmed with the cashier that I ordered my sandwich hot, and she said yes you did.  After a discussion with the cook, she explained they did cook it but the veggies made the sandwich cold.  The cheese was not melted so I was confused.  She was going to talk to the mgr about it, but by this time I was starving and simply said it's fine.  It was not fine!!   I took one bite and I was upset.  I had waited so long and it was just a runny, soggy, mess.  I scraped all the toppings off and tried to eat it but it was too late.  The cashier and the cook offered ZERO solutions.  The both saw how absolutely hangry I was at this point and didn't even bother asking a manager to talk with me about it.  No offer to remake it, reheat it, NOTHING.  For just over $50 bucks with a tip, this is unacceptable.  

Love Miller brothers brand, however there is simply something about the overall customer experience that is lacking at all locations with the exception of Serial Grillers on River.",11-12-2021 23:43,0

When you first walk in the gates - it is adorable with great vibes. It reminded me of a brewery with all the games and outdoor space and seating. Our time at Barnyard began with my family and I grabbing drinks and playing a game of corn hole while catching up at one of their various outdoor seating locations. Everything was great until an hour and a half came and we still weren't seated. By the time we were seated inside we were nearly dehydrated and exhausted from the August desert heat. Once we were seated we were not waited on for quite a while. When we did have our drinks ordered we saw them sitting there at the bar. At one point I was about to grab the drinks for my family. It was unfortunate that we had to tell our waiter to grab our drinks. From that point we waited more and more for us to get the attention of our waiter to ask us for our order. We waited nearly 30 more minutes for 2 appetizers. 

Long story short - Barnyard cannot accommodate large parties. Although it seems like a great place with cool vibes to have birthdays, anniversaries, parties, etc. I would stray away.

After reviewing different locations here in Tucson we (mom, husband and me) decided on Barnyard. It was absolutely adorable online in photos and just had a really nice look. It felt like it would be bustling with happy workers, yard games and people drinking and having a good time.

Unfortunately my experience was not so great.

We met up at 630pm yesterday 7/20 for this new restaurant to celebrate two birthdays actually. The yard was adorable and just like in photos (hence 3 stars and not 1). It was an absolutely friendly environment outside, but I can't say the same for inside. 
When you walk into the building you are greeted with two hostesses in the front and they seem a little unenthusiastic and not welcoming. Well we got seated and had asked if we can go to another table, but was told it was reserved for a party of 6 so we didn't have any issues since it was reserved. It was a tight squeeze between tables and a little loud since the room was so open and small. Mind you there was quite a bit of people, but we could see the kitchen was very chatty and looked to have enough time to get orders in and some right away. 
We sat at our table with menus for what felt like 10 minutes or so without drinks, then the server came and brought us waters. I asked for lemons and was met with not a very welcoming feeling or smiles. Then beers were ordered and it took about another 10 minutes. We were ready to order but she walked away very fast every time and made it seem very awkward. So we waited about 15-20minutes before she came back, I asked for an appetizer and then she moved on before I could order. I had to ask to order food, and then she came back and asked if I wanted the appetizer before the entrees to which I agreed. 
I had to get up to the bar to get refills of water since I would look at her and she never checked on us. She would walk past our table and then stand in the kitchen in a huddle with other employees just chit chatting. 
We finally got food maybe 30-40 minutes after ordering and we were missing the appetizer. So we asked for no appetizer and to take it off the bill, and some ketchup. Ketchup took about 5 minutes.. I can't explain how small the inside of this restaurant is. I only saw her work 2 more tables besides us. 
Then finally after a total of 1.5 hours at this resturant we were going to leave after asking for the check and she never came to take the card. So we waiting a little longer and then went to the bar to break money to leave cash since it didn't seem like she was coming any time soon. 

I'm so disappointed in the service and inside environment. It felt like all of the staff had the same attitude and lack of motivation. Employees attitudes and lack of excitement really showed and maybe it was because it was a Tuesday night, who knows. 

The food was okay, but not worth it to come back and have the same experience. I would rather refer friends and family to other local places.

We enjoyed the following: chicken Marsala, veggie pizza, fried zucchini, and garlic knots. 

The food is so good, like literally you don't know how much you have eaten until you are so stuffed  you must stop, yet, your tastebuds are wishing you could keep going. 

My only complaint (I think the food is very reasonable in price). But, it is $1.00 for a side container of ranch - the size of a McDonald's dipping sauce is $1.00!

This place is still fairly new and has some kinks to work out. I'm sure it will be pretty successful.
I was happy to see the bar situation. It's pretty cool. It was an inside/outside bar. The bartenders looked professional. They were smiling and looked to be having fun; except for the female ""bartender"". I smiled at her, she didn't seem too happy that evening. Whatever ( evening of June 30, 2021)
I noticed that Manhattans were one of their drink options, so when a handsome bartender took my drink order, I said that I would like a perfect Manhattan. (Perfect means half sweet half dry vermouth). This is a signature drink they highlight in their menu. Surely, if a cocktail like a Manhattan is one of the main features, you're in the right place. Manhattans aren't usually a ""specialty cocktail"". He looked puzzled but told me he'd have one of the bartenders make it. A few minutes go by and I observe the female bartender get a martini glass, filled it with ice to chill the glass. I see all these ladies sitting around me outside with their pretty martini, and wine glasses and look forward to mine. Surely this is my glass she's prepping for the Manhattan I'm about to receive. 
The female bartender pours everything into a shaker, shakes the crap out of it, takes the martini glass, dumps the ice in a sink, puts the glass away, grabs a plastic cup and dumps the cocktail in that. My hopes of having a pretty drink like the others were dashed as she slid that plastic cup in my direction. I picked it up and looked at this frothy mess in disbelief. I'm pretty sure she heard me say, ""she shook it, I can't believe she shook bourbon"". I just figured that I have encountered another person playing bartender. She'll get it right one day. I was not going to bother correcting the girl. She seemed unhappy anyway. 
I understand that they use plastic for those of us around the outside area, but when I see all the tables with glasses and the ladies standing  right next to me outside at the same bar area, I was hoping a fancy cocktail would have come in the proper fancy glass to me as well. The only thing that would have made it ""perfect"" now was if she had poured that mess into a red solo cup. 
Once we were seated inside, I made the choice to switch to wine, I knew it was safe that it wouldn't be ruined and it would hopefully come in a real glass. Eureka!! It did. We had a table full of plastic cups and glasses by the end of the evening. 
It was a beautiful place. I hope it's still around when we return home to Tucson. The little things are little, this place is ideal all the way around. I recommend people reading this to go and experience it yourself.",07-01-2021 13:18,0

It just is. That said, a huge part of DSP is getting the corners where the cheese grease has melted over the edge and caramelized the dough so I UNDERSTAND the thought process: every piece gets an awesome crunch ...ish. The dough was over-worked, DSP should be airy, crunchy and not too chewy. The sauce which some complained on other reviews as being ""too sweet"" is actually fairly on point. It's San marzano tomato sauce and that's exactly what those tomatoes are - perfectly acidic and sweet.

It was still tasty....the fried kurds were absolutely horrible, having the consistency of old hard chewing gum and over fried...they must get them in a frozen package?? I recommend the franchisee take a  trip to Casey Jones in Phoenix to get an  idea of what REAL cheese kurds taste  like.  I have to  say our service was above  par as she kept giving our tabLes refills without asking, excellent service.  I gave 4 stars because of tHe kurds and soggy weird pizza.

My husband asked what's in the mussel sauce. he didn't once meantion it had pork in it. I took a few bites and as someone who doesn't eat pork knew something was off. I then throw up in their bathroom and told them I didn't want my food as I didn't know if there was pork in mine either. Here comes the bill and my entree ( which was also mussels ) was in it Still. Not only that but the side salad the waiter said it came with was an extra charge ( which I didn't touch either) asked to speak to the manager. He said well we made it so you have to pay for it.

We paid 33$ (!!) for two small pizzas: one Margherita and the other one was Margherita+nduja (which cost 5$ extra).
Nduja is a bright red, very spicy paste. Whatever was on the pizza was nothing like nduja. It wasn't spicy, it wasn't enough, and it was burnt. 
The Margherita wasn't too bad but soooo little mozzarella. Barely one piece of mozzarella per slice. So sad. Also the bottom tasted burnt.

If we were dining in I would for sure have sent them back. I can't believe it cost us 33 dollars and I've had frozen, cheaper pizzas taste better. I'm willing to pay for quality but I truly don't understand what I paid for here.",07-11-2020 02:39,0

We ordered the nachos and the farmhouse board for food. We also ordered the chili but it was sold out. The nachos were typical nachos, lots of topping and had good flavor. The board was disappointing for $25 it came with a few chunks of pepper jack cheese, olives, cheese jalapeño sausage, dates, 2 small slices of bread and lots of lettuce? There was also a mustard and some sort of spread the bartender also couldn't identify for us. I specifically asked prior to ordering what was on the board the bartender had no idea and just said it was popular.

A friend who frequents Anello has the winning strategy though: get there RIGHT when they open. It's a tiny place, so if you're not one of the first groups seated, the wait balloons incredibly quickly over the course of the evening. 

At any rate, I'm very pleased to have finally eaten here! We started with the Seasonal Veggies, which on this occasion were roasted turnips. The turnips were served with goat cheese, hazelnuts, and shaved apples, and the combination was excellent. This was probably my favorite dish; the earthy root vegetables paired beautifully with the creamy cheese and bright apple. 

We next had the Focaccia + Ricotta -- it's precisely what it sounds like. The focaccia is brought out hot, with a cool ricotta spread and sweet drizzle of jam. The salty bread has charred bubbles and a hint of oil and rosemary. It's lovely, but very filling. Plan accordingly! 

We then arrived at the Margherita Pizza, to which we added sausage. The tomato sauce is light and had a good acidity to cut through the richness of the cheese and sausage. 

Be aware that the menu is very limited; the food is good, but there are only a few pizzas and not very many ways to customize them. Anello is a strong presence in the Tucson pizza scene, but it's definitely not a place for unique or off-the-wall toppings. Instead, head here when you're looking for simple, rich, and satisfying pizza! 

And remember: either come early, or be ready to wait.",2/22/2020 5:08,1

The crispy cheese around the edge is too good. Get this! 
I also had the Detroit Bread and that was so super yummy. Perfectly crispy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside.

We enjoyed, garlic knots, veggie pizza (without Bell peppers and onions), chicken Marsala, lasagna soup, and chopped salad.

The highlight of the meal was the veggie pizza and the ambiance. The seating is a bit crowded but the low light, candles on each table, and live music really made it nice. 

The food is absolutely worth it! The chopped salad was fresh and crisp with a twist of Italian flavors. The garlic knots were okay, a little doughy but good. The chicken Marsala had a thick, sweet Marsala sauce with tender chicken and delicious fettuccine noodles. The 12"" veggie pizza was A LOT of food but so so so worth it, really wonderful red sauce and thin breading so you could experience each flavor. I would probably not order the lasagna soup again as it really tasted like lasagna and was good but not what my tastebuds desired as a starter. 

In truth we waited 20 minutes to be seated and that was a little awkward as the seating to wait is outside and it was cold so we stood by the bar. Just for your knowledge the pizza does take 30ish minutes to cook so if you are super hungry that might not be your meal option. It did seem they had call ahead seating - will do that next time!

We started with some complimentary garlic knots. They were okay, I felt they could have used a few more minutes of baking. We started with fried zucchini. Large slices of zucchini were pan fried with a light breading. They were tasty but needed some salt. This was not your deep fried way to sneak in some veggies - it's definitely more zucchini than breading.

Our meals came with salads so we started with a house and cesar salad. Both were standard but fresh and tasty. I wasn't feeling like tomato sauce that night so I ordered the chicken alfredo. The pasta was a tad too al dente. The sauce wasn't super flavorful and I didn't like the texture of the chicken. Not sure if it was previously frozen or overcooked, but it unfortunately wasn't the best. The hubs ordered lasagna and enjoyed his meal.

The dining room is large and cavernous and generally on the dark side.  Bring a flashlight.  The service was fine -- our service was okay, neither amazing nor terrible.  Read the experience of other Yelpers and you will see that true heros exist amongst the serving staff.  I believe that will make or break your visit. Get the right server, and you're likely to have a marvelous time.

The menu is very large -- many, many, options.  So what to pick?  The website boasts that the menu has over 140+ items.  Whoa.  So what do they actually do well?  I have experienced some national restaurant chains can pull this off -- to ensure that no matter what you order on their giant menu, the food will be great.  I did not see evidence of that here.

Tucson has many, many, amazing restaurants.  This is not one of them.  If you're not here for the beer, try somewhere else.",1/20/2020 0:52,0

Finally got second drink order after everyone had been empty for a while.
Finally got to order food about another 30 minutes later.
Sitting at table for two hours before the food came out.
All food came out cold.
They ran out of utensils so we were given plasticware and paper towels that look like they are from the bathroom dispenser.
Ordered a rare hamburger, came out medium 
Ordered ham & pineapple pizza....no ham on pizza
Chicken sandwich was supposed to have ranch, no ranch. No sides of ranch for everyone at the table that requested it. Finally came out after food was even colder.
FISH and chips was still borderline frozen inside.

I get it....they are short staffed. Aissa was super apologetic and gave us a free pizooki and said she'd let the manager know about our experience.
Manager made it right with taking the fish and chips off of the bill and gave us a discount on Everything else.
Note: they don't have ham there so the pizza was just a pineapple pizza.

We are super easy going but is was a dinner to congratulate my nephew and his wife, they just got married!

Not a great experience. Don't think I'll be back.

I ordered the Arugula and Avocado salad with an added piece of grilled salmon, cooked medium. It was ten dollars with a nine dollar up charge for the salmon, so, nineteen dollars for the dish. I do remember thinking, ""this is about the best salad that I have ever had--anywhere"". Fast forward a week or so, this time, we returned on a Tuesday and I had the same salad with the piece of salmon and I was really looking forward to it. The salmon was the same-- beautifully cooked, succulent and piping hot. The salad was a huge pile of arugula with some tiny chunks of avocado and that's about it. It was a completely different salad. In fact, it was not even a salad, but simply a huge bed of arugula for the salmon to be placed upon. I guess the kitchen thought that was good enough. If I had ordered the salad separately for ten dollars and it came like that, anyone would have had a real issue with it, but I didn't want to because I was really hungry,and the salmon would have suffered for it. So, I went with it and paid for it. However, it did destroy my confidence in the place because I've had that dish prepared better. Awful.",02-05-2020 00:46,0

Came here with my boyfriend because it was one of the few places open late night. Ordered our food to go and had to wait almost 50 minutes to receive our food only after we had asked a worker how much longer our food was going to take. We asked politely and didn't even mention how long we had been waiting. She came back with our food after 10 minutes or so along with a couple's food who had ordered their food also to go 10 minutes prior. Our order was shoved in the bag and piled on top of each other as if rushed. We left and i proceeded to make sure our order was correct in the car. I specifically ordered the dry rub applewood and received wings with sauce and was extremely disappointed. Didn't bother to go back in to correct the order because we had already waited 50 minutes. Our fries were soggy, wings were cold, our burger and chicken sand which were crammed inside a small container with all the contents spilled out and my chicken was burnt. The avocado was raw and hard. Mind you I am not a picky eater but our food was not acceptable especially considering how long we had to wait.

This is by far the worst managed restaurant I have ever worked in. 90% of the time  they don't order items that we ran out of so it's rare if you actually get what you WANT when eating there. The bar is set very low at that store, so low I'm surprised they haven't been shut down. Chemicals left in the tea urns you're drinking out of, premade salads that will get left for days, lemons that get left out over night. Managers will even eat off the plates before they get sent out to the tables. I'd give you a dollar if you had a manager ever go over to the table and ask to see how everything was doing. They're  the most useless people there, who just sit around in the office doing the bare minimum and then will treat you like an inconvenience when any sort of problem arises. I've seen a dead rat there just be kicked underneath a pile so nobody would see it.  Do not work there, eat there,, give them any $$, put that restaurant out of its misery and let it go bankrupt.

The first time we went together was on the south side, but the rest of the experience was at the Speedway restaurant. Since then, I had lunch there with my business partner several times, and Oregano's always delivers the goods.

There are many aspects I like at Oregano's. For one thing, the food is delicious. My favorite is the Big Beefstro Salad: fresh shredded green salad (not tasteless lettuce, but real salad with a great flavor) with strips of a delicious marinated beef, sprinkled with cheese and a sweet serrano sauce which is to die for. This 'miracle' sauce was missing on a couple of occasions, and I switched to a balsamic vinaigrette which was also really tasty. The portions are HUGE. Every time I have lunch there, everyone around the table agrees the portions are REALLY BIG. 

The service is the second aspect I love: the waitresses are extremely nice and they pay attention to what you need. Last lunch, the young lady who had served me before recognized me even though I was wearing a mask! The service is fast, even when the galley is busy around noon. 

The third aspect I like is their coffee. They brew it on demand, and it is smooth and full-bodied, not bitter at all. Coffee is an important part of lunch for me, so I really appreciate a great cup of java.

The environment is pleasant. The backroom at Speedway is very large, there is plenty of space between tables, and there is a beautiful mural I can't stop admiring. The only suggestion I would offer would be to turn down just a tad the volume of the music. I like the selection of tunes, lots of crooners of the 50s and 60s, but sometimes I find the music a bit loud for conversation.

Price-wise, my favorite salad comes at around $13, which is very reasonable considering quality and volume. With coffee and tip, a regular tab is about $20.

We introduced 3 other families to the restaurant on Speedway taking them there; sometimes we ate there twice in the space of days with new friends.  

Today, the service at the Cortaro location embarrassed my wife and essentially punished us for having the audacity to support a long time local favorite. I ordered online and my wife was out and about to pick up (her suggestion). I used the online portal and asked if they could toast the buns and swap out a cheese on one of three orders in their ""special instructions"" part of their website.  The rest of their website allows you to check boxes for what you do or don't want... there are even online options to build your own order (e.g. burger or cheesesteak) from scratch. When my wife got there at the appointed order time the lady at the cash register said the order wasn't ready.  She looked at the screen and said, ""what the H*ll!?,"" and walked back to the kitchen shouting for all to hear,  ""have you started this order... the really complicated one!?"" My wife actually apologized for the complicated order not knowing what I had asked (again, toasted buns and a cheese swap). The cashier just said,  ""it's okay, I don't have to cook it."" It was only a $30+ order, but it made me wonder if using their web portal means they mess with the food if you use their ""special instructions"" section of the website.

Upon arrival (26 minutes after I placed the order) I was told that it was going to be another 10 minutes because they were just now putting them in the oven. Ok so this was not a big deal. 

Once we arrived home and opened the box with the 2 calzones in it I was in shock. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box to see 2 nearly flat calzones inside. They were as flat as a pizza when they were supposed to be ""stuffed"" with the cheeses they automatically put on them along with the 2 extra ingredients i requested (1-with pepperoni and mushrooms, 2-with ham and pineapple). 

Every calzone I've ever had in my 54 years of life has been truly ""stuffed"". The two we got here barely had any of the 2 extra ingredients we paid for, the one with pineapple and ham only had 8 pieces of pineapple and five small pieces of ham. 

We spent just over $25 for these and you can be sure we'll NEVER be back. Word of mouth is some of the best advertisement you can hope for and I will tell everyone I know about this piss poor experience with this Brooklyn Pizza Company.

First time we each had a slice and it wasn't tasty enough that I would've ordered it again (bland and a bit dry, but the crust was good), so when we went back the next week we got an order of wings instead of slices.  They were awful, truly.  I believe they must've been baked bc they were nearly all fat.  They were served in a round silver container and were so mushy and fatty I tried scraping off the fatty outer skin layer to just eat the meat but it was all just a mushy mess.  We ended up throwing them away.  I was very disappointed, especially given the price.  The draw to this place right now is the comfy open seating at the adjoining sky bar which has a friendly staff and shaded bar.

I enjoyed the visit so much, I decided to try the Tucson location over the MLK weekend.  I had joined the OC club that allows you to accumulate points for each visit.  I also discovered that as a club member, you get a $17 discount on a medium one-topping pizza for your birthday and you have a week to take advantage of that.  My birthday is on the 20th and I visited on the 19th.

Finding that out, I decided to try their Veggie 7 pizza.  The pizza was large enough for two people! I also had two craft beers.  It was Happy Hour, so the pizza and two beers was only $12.  (The pizza alone is $19.29) The pizza was loaded with crisp vegetables and the crust had a buttery crispiness to it.  It was a very tasty meal accentuated with fast and friendly service.

This is a large restaurant with a big parking area.  I do plan to return to this place as I got a coupon for a free appetizer with my meal here.

This place does not disappoint with that line of thought. There is honey in the pizza crust, cheese in the pesto, milk in the house bread and egg whites in the gluten free house bread. Oiy! We decided honey was the least offensive choice and went with a pizza. Here's the annoying part, our waiter 100% failed to mention customizing a pizza COSTS A LOT. One pizza came out to $25! It fed two people and all it had were veggies. The house salad was nearly $7. One martini with Grey Goose was $14, my waiter failed to enter in my martini with house vodka and charged $4 more. I had to correct the bill. 
Speaking of our waiter, at first very attentive but after a half hour disappeared and we had to wait awhile till he returned. He was knowledgeable about asking what was not vegan in the kitchen. However, I wish he explained additional costs better. 
The pizza overall was delicious, yes I know honey! Ugh. If you cannot deal with honey in a rare occasion I highly suggest you either avoid this place or just come here for drinks. 
The patio is dog friendly and I suggest you make a reservation for the fire pits outside in the winter, which only seat 6 people.

Our family of seven went on Sunday this past week to enjoy a meal together. One of my family members has a disability and so we requested to sit on the patio. We always do this, no problem at all. We enjoy that the patio just has two tables which is just the right size for our family and the fact that it is completely away from all other guests, so very COVID friendly. 

I noticed as we walked up that the patio was already empty, which was excellent. When we arrived we were quoted 5-10 minutes. Then after about 15 minutes we asked if it was time, the answer was no and that it would be an additional 25-40 minutes. I walked around the building and sure enough, the patio was still empty. I complained to the host and he rolled his eyes but still took us back. As he took us back he tossed the menus onto the table and walked away. He didn't even wait for our whole party to get to the patio (everyone who was behind the family member in the wheelchair didn't even see him once he left the host stand). 

The tables were maybe 2 feet from one another. We pushed them together as we are one family and we have always sat together. Host boy runs back out to tell us to separate the tables because it is a health code violation. He may want to be careful saying things like this because I have no problem calling the health department to have them evaluate the situation. We asked for the manager, he came out and was adequate. He wasn't extremely pleasant but did his job well enough that we were fine. He explained it is actually just company policy but since these were the only two tables on the patio he would ""make an exception""....oh joy. Notice, someone (either manager or host) was blatantly lying. My vote is for the manager as he tried to tell me I was lying about the wait times. I made a phone call after putting our name in so I had a time stamp, maybe try not to accuse your customers of lying. 

The plates that were brought to the table for apps were dirty and our waitress was overall unattentive. So much so we had to walk in to find her to place our dessert order and to pay our bill (after waiting 20-30 minutes to do each of those things). 

Overall poor experience and likely won't be returning for quite some time.

First two experiences were great, last one, not so much.  We've been pleased with all the special offers they've had and I was super excited about the Mother's Day Bellini special.  I called at 4 pm, thinking I was beating the rush, but was told it would be 2 1/2 hours.  I then called another location and was told an hour but was put on hold til I got disconnected so I called this location back.  It was now a 3 hour wait for food.  We'd had a later lunch so decided to place an order.  We were told food would be ready in about 3 hours.  We showed up 2 hours and 40 minutes later, 20 minutes before we were told our food would be ready, we were ok with waiting for hot food.  When we walked in, we were in shock of all the bags of food just sitting around at all the tables.  It appeared that there were premade salads too just sitting in the back area behind the bar.  Things were organized in groups by the first letter of your first name.  After paying we checked in with someone who checked on our order, to our surprise, it was sitting on a table waiting for us.  We wondered how long it had been sitting waiting.  All our food was room temperature.  The flavor was ok but that was about it, food was soft and mushy and not even warm.  We would have complained but everyone was so stressed we just reheated things at home.  Still didn't make it the great Oreganos food we are used to.  I'm hoping we don't get any type of food poising from our food sitting out for who knows how long.  I think they bit of more than they could chew on this deal.  They should have stopped taking orders.  I know people would have been upset.  Maybe take down peoples emails or mailing address and send coupons for $1 bellinis once they reopen?  I would have been fine with that.  What I got for Mother's Day was basically $50 worth of food that was no where near the quality that I've gotten all the other times.

We shared the Zucca Chips, which were delicious, and we both had a glass of sangria.  The sangria was smooth and refreshing, my only suggestion would be to use a better glass, only because the tall, skinny glasses that it came in were difficult to drink a highly-iced drink from.

I ordered the spicy vodka sauce & sausage pasta, it was sooooo good.   The complaint about that pasta actually goes to my husband, who devoured my leftovers as soon as I got home (dang it!).

The only real disappointment of the meal/food was the dessert.... I think it's called bombalino?  It's little donuts with lemon sauce & custard.  The dough was incredibly heavy and dense and the sauces were lack-luster.  We won't order that one again.

It was an easy 5 stars. Sadly, we had our last meal from this Oregano's last night. Their food quality and consistency has been going down for years, and last night was the last straw. I'm a creature of habit and pretty much order the same things every time so it's pretty easy to see the changes.

The guacamole used to be so good, but now it's so filled with tomatoes that the acidity ruins the flavor. The crust that comes with the guacamole used to be cooked perfectly every time. Now it's always burnt. We started ordering it with a ""light bake"" to get it back to what it was, but even that is now overcooked. We used to order this every time, but now we don't even bother.

A stuffed pizza was another staple in my orders. It satisfied my itch for the thick, Chicago style pizza I love. Now when I order, I never know if I'm going to get a thick delicious pizza, or a thin sad looking version. In the last one I ordered, they used rancid oil in the pan which infused the crust with a disgusting taste and smell. After a few bites we threw the whole thing out.

Last night we ordered traditional style mac & cheese, boom dip, and a cookie. The mac & cheese looked perfect. Unfortunately, whoever cooked it burnt it and served us the non-burnt portion because it had an awful, awful burnt flavor. After a few bites it went in the trash. The boom dip normally comes with these really thin bread sticks. This time they were an inch thick. They were still good, but again, no consistency anymore.

First a gentlemen's answers the phone, I order Alfredo The Dark Pasta, and I wanted to get a pizza. He said the pizza wait is over 1 hour. So I told him to allow me to call him back within 1 minute to confirm what I want in replacement of the Pizza. So then I call back and he answers again, I told him I was ready to continue and that I knew what I wanted in replacement. He placed me on hold, I remained on hold for 6 minutes total. I decided to hang up and call back, once I call the 2nd time a female answers the phone. I then tell her I was on hold for 6 minutes and was trying to finish placing my order. She asked for my name, then she told me my order wasn't saved so we had to start over. It got me a little upset but I placed my order with her and told her I wanted the Alfredo the dark pasta, and An order of wings I told her Honey gold mixed with hot. She then specified that flavor doesn't exist and the only similar is an Italian flavor. I said ""every time I go to speedway location they get my order correct"" and she basically sounded hesitant to take my wing flavor order over the phone. I asked her to get her manager for me then over the phone. She placed me on hold. Now I am on hold for a total of 8 minutes. So what did I do? I hung up. And drove from the north side all the way to the speedway location of oreganos, got my pizza, wings, and pasta. Successfully from the speedway location with no hesitation of the flavored wings I wanted, I wasn't on hold at all, and the service over the phone was remarkable. It disappoints me that this location provides such discouraging service over the phone and was not professional and basically just kept placing me on hold. I will not return to this location.

I mean no harm other than to share my opinion, that hopefully it helps a business if nothing else.

. . . . .

Thoughts..

Despite Arizona not being quite the same as NYC as far as pizza goes and also having NYC my 2nd home, have felt Brooklyn's Pizza is/was as close as it gets when it comes to a true NYC style pizza..

Brooklyn's over the years has fluctuated from best, to worse, to best, etc... in other words, it hasn't, and isn't consistently good, which doesn't live up to its name/inspiration for its pizza/city.. that is one thing that differentiates it most from it's city's referenced name.. (unfortunately)...

Over the years, i have found that some of the things that determine good pizza at Brooklyn's, (since yes, it does depend), that at times, it does have to do with certain things, like the time of day, if it's a holiday, if they just switched management, is the kitchen is short staff, etc.. That may be no surprise, seeing as so many restaurants deal with the same challenges, however...
 ....it is something that can perfected with good leadership and good methods of operation...


MY REVIEW:

I come in every once in a while, for both slices or whole pies...
I came in recently, and was probably the most sadden I have ever been for a business, not just because I love the place, but mostly because I've never experienced something so so bad ever from the restaurant, and any for that matter.

The store has been serviced from their makeshift window serviced to the sidewalk outside... (Cool!)...
I ordered around 7, PM, dinner rush/holiday, costumers in line.. 
I ordered a slice and half dozen garlic knots when it is my turn to order. I was given a wait time of 10-15 minutes at most. ( to be expected).. but not horrible since it wasn't super busy... yet...
I wait, as people slowly crowded the sidewalk.. one person orders whole pies, another is picking orders up, the staff isn't small, but busy at work, especially the sweet front window girl, who is doing her best to fulfill orders while also being the runner for the food to the window for pickup as it becomes more and more busier, and as I continue to wait, as people come and go..

It's now been 20 minutes.. I do my best to wait patiently, but nothing, while I see that people who ordered almost less food than me are managing to get their orders and clear the crowd, of which is growing as I wait longer... 
I finally went ahead and inquired of my order, just to see why a single slice and 6 garlic knots are having to be done after others..
The girl who was frantically looking for my ticket for at least a minute, comes back and tells me it must've gotten misplaced, and that it would be a few more minutes, and that if I wanted I refund she would do that for me.. I politely tell her it is ok, and that I would continue to wait fir it to be done..
I then wait another 10 more minutes.. now, this may not seem like a long time, but keep in mind, I had already been standing there for 20 or so minutes, and now it's been 30-35... for 1 slice... and 6 garlic knots... while people come and go with bigger orders, people that had just put orders in.. by now I'm at that ""Karen"" stage, but doing my best to politely inquire again about my order.. the girl starts to realize, and is aware that a very long time has come and gone, and that I was anxious/annoyed, to which she replies that she is gonna cry when I asked for how many more minutes, and that I would like to take her up on the refund that she offered me before, and that she will get her manager, as she has tears in her eyes..
The poor girl had to bring the manager, just to be refunded.. the manager didn't take time to even hear how long I had been there, but felt the need to explain that it was busy, and the now scariest of me girl, hands me a very burnt, dried, slice of pizza that had been waiting for its counter part ""garlic knots"" to also be ready.. (I wonder): ""how long was that waiting for me as much as I was waiting for it??"", seeing as so it was as dry as my mouth, standing out in the warm summer 4th Ave evening heat.. the poor child handed me my burnt slice that I had to ask to be taken to go, and handed to me in a sweet, little doggie bag, that is also now a sad upside down/sideways little doggie bag of what we call, ""worth the wait"".",07-06-2021 18:46,1

I came here as a delivery driver to pick up a third-party delivery order.  As I approached the storefront, there were two other customers waiting near the pick-up window.  Those customers are served their slices, and I step up to the service area immediately.  Six months ago, I wouldn't have been able to be so specific, but I was exactly six feet behind those customers.  Nevertheless, the staff inside ignores me and turns his back to retreat into the inaccessible bowels of the kitchen. 

Well, technically, I suppose I should have been at the ordering window; not the pick-up door, but I was aware of that in the moment and I moved back to the ordering window.  The ordering window was unstaffed, and there was no bell present to get the staff's attention.  So, I waited...  and waited... and waited... and waited.  Not really feeling comfortable screaming for attention on a public sidewalk, I began to wonder if they would answer the phone.  I retreated from the 110 degree heat to my car, and I just called the restaurant from about 8' outside their front door.  Surprisingly, someone answered.  I told him what order I was there to pick up and asked if it was ready.  He put me on hold for about 3 minutes, but came back to the line and told me the order was ready.  What luck!  Finally, this ordeal might be over.  I was calling the store from about 8 feet in front of the front door.  I told him over the phone that I would meet him at the pick up door immediately.

So, I went back to the door.  And I waited... and waited... and waited... and waited.  No staff and no pizza had appeared.  Again, I retreated from the 110 degree heat into my car.  This time, I called the company for which I was driving.  She put me on hold after I explained the situation in order to call Brooklyn.  When she came back to the line she explained that they wouldn't bring the pizza to the car, but they would bring it to the door.  I was frustrated, because I had never asked anyone to deliver the order to my car.  I still hadn't managed to attract staff to the ordering window or the pickup door; that was why I had called.  It just goes to show you how much we all suffer from off-shoring our call-center jobs.  I guess I was just going to have to overcome my reluctance to scream from the sidewalk for attention.

I went back to the ordering window, with my insulated bag in hand, and screamed from the sidewalk, ""Hello?  Are you open?  Pickup for Susan!"" (name altered).  I did get a response from inside, ""Yes""  someone shouted back.  Still, no one would approach the window or the door.  

I eventually had to take a penalty and a direct loss and just abandon this pickup.  No one EVER came to the door OR the window for me.  That's so inept that it defies any attempt to categorize it as ""innocent.""  These people are just EVIL.  

In conclusion, that's how hard it is to pick up a pizza from Brooklyn, and that's how little their staff regards their customers.  I used to order food from Brooklyn at least once a month.  In fact, I have a Brooklyn pizza box in my recycling now.  They've lost that business too, from this.  These people could just not care any less than they do.",07-09-2020 22:22,0

I ordered my food using the website online order system, and received my order confirmation at 4:30 pm.  It was promised at 5:30.  I arrived a 5:35, quickly checked in with the hostess, and waited an additional 30 minutes, receiving my food at 6:05 pm -- a solid 90 minutes for two pizzas: a chicago pan pizza and a regular thin crust. At least one other person apparently had a similar wait time.  I thought I was beating the rush.  I was mistaken.

There were a couple of disappointments.  Driving home, you can expect the pies to cool a bit.  Oddly, I thought, the chicago stuffed was cooler -- almost cold -- than the thin crust, implying it came out of the oven and sat around for a bit.  Meh.  Okay.  I can get over that.  For such things there are ovens and microwaves.  The other was the presence of an ingredient we didn't order and which we actively attempt to avoid.  Didn't expect it.  Was not part of the description.

So what do I think?  We picked Oregano's because they are one of the few shops with the more ""exotic"" ingredients, such as artichoke hearts and GREEN olives (available almost nowhere else), but they have got to have the slowest kitchen pizza place I've ever eaten at.  Even when we would eat in the dining room, I never thought the kitchen was all that fast, and every time we tried to order the stuffed pizza, the server would wave us off -- ""that takes an hour to make"".  Wow.  So -- do you like the food here so much that a 60 to 90 minute wait is okay?

Great flavor and it had blueberry compote beside it, whipped topping of some kind on top of it, and some crumbly pieces sprinkled around the plate. One piece was perfect for the two of us to share.

While it pains me to write a poor review of the place it needs to be said if management does care about their customers. The lousy service my wife and daughter received tonight was terrible! After waiting 1-1/2 hours just to get a table we ordered the Chicago Pan Carne Asada pizza that we've ordered many times before at other Oregano locations and not only was it the worst dish that we've ever had at Oreganos, it was the worst pizza that I've had in my 53 years on the planet. Plus, it took an additional 45 minutes to prepare which we were warned about ahead of time. Okay, we're thinking that it should be worth the wait. Far from it.

The pizza tonight was all cheese, virtually no carne asada whatsoever and the dough was under cooked. Whoever is running the kitchen back there, they should be ashamed that they allowed that pie to go out from the pass. 

After being asked by our female server what we thought of our meal we replied to her that it was terrible. 

To add insult to injury our server did absolutely NOTHING to rectify the situation. We were not asked if would like another dish to replace the disaster of a pie that they served us. Nope. We were not offered to take the charge off our tab. All we got from her was ""I'll get your check"".

For instance, I recently ordered a sicilian slice, and they brought me two slices of plain on thin crust to make up for not having it in stock. While I appreciated their effort, I would have preferred that they contacted me and let me know what was going on, and to provide me with some options.

I understand the struggle that all restaurants and food establishments are dealing with during these unforeseen times!!  What I don't understand is why they have fallen in customer service when you would think it would be a bigger priority since they are now dealing with take out and delivery orders for the majority of their business!
James answered the phone and informed me he was the only one there working the phones and making the pizzas. I explained to him I used to be able to give my phone number and they had the pizza I always ordered in their computer and would have the whole transaction done in 2 minutes. 
He was so sweet....looked up my phone number, found my same pizza order, my address and
had the pizza delivered on time!!
Thank you James!! You deserve a raise!! 
Giving 5 Stars because of you!!!

Tonight was just not that. 
Started with grilled bread & ""good"" olive oil along with an order of the Meatballs. Both were cold. Maybe the bread isn't supposed to be hot but this order was colder than room temp.. like it was pre-grilled two hours ago and set aside?  Then the meatballs were warm at best? The mini-metal pan they were served in was barely warm to the touch and the cheese with them was already coagulated? How were they heated in this little pan and the pan wasn't even warm to the touch? 

Then a marg pizza... it came out 1/2 way through our 1st course... again barely warm. It definitely tasted like it was fired too soon, sat on the line for ten minutes before a cook finally said ""just send it out so I don't have to make another one."" Now, I love left over pizza, but not when it is brought to the table that way. Very disappointed.

The server was pleasant enough but his timing was not great. He had a trainee following him so that may have thrown him off his game. Servers need to be doing check backs after food is delivered. Especially if the food is cold.

Everything from the food to the decor was amazing and seems to be very true to the Italian style. Definitely a high class place, don't make the mistake of walking in with running shorts and sliders like I did. While they don't require any dress code, it only seemed respectful to put more effort into my attire since they put so much effort into their entire restaurant. But even with our casual outfits they still treated us with the same kindness as everyone else. 
We came in right before their dinner rush, and they were pretty packed by the time we left. Since we were here on a Tuesday, I can't imagine how popular they are on weekends! 
I came with my sister, but this is definitely a lovely date spot. We got the white truffle garlic bread as a starter and that created a whole new standard for garlic bread in my book. We devoured the entire thing with no breaks. For the entree, i had to get the bolognese, a house speciality and boy was it worth the hype! My sister got the strozzapreti and it also looked very appetizing!
My only complaint is the time that it takes, which I barely even label a complaint  because they make everything from scratch. We literally had a front row seat to some of the magic! They did have a couple flies come in to join us but who can blame them when the food looks and smells so good!

We could see kitchen and tons of to go orders.  I suspect that they give to go orders priority which I resent.  We asked for 4 waters, 1 wine, 1 beer and 1 ice tea.  Two waters were delivered.  We waited and waited.  Waiter came up, excuses...then came out the rest of our drinks, but no more waters!

He sped it out of the kitchen and I swear that whatever it was, it was not real calimari...white rubber little finger sized strips.  The marinara was so thick, cold and impossible to scoop out of the tiny  cup.  Finally a thick crust pizza lands on the table, waiter tells me that the kitchen didn't make my pizza the way I ordered it but that I can have it the way it was made.  What?  We were so hungry, I said just bring it....so here's the deal.  They offer super thick crust deep dish pizza and thin crust.  The thin crust is so thin, that I couldn't even see it or taste it.  Folks, am I crazy?  When I go out for pizza I want to get a nice hand stretched crust that tastes good and that acts as a base for all the goodies.  The pizza not only had nothing resembling a crust, but it was so over baked that the cheese was tough and I couldn't take the veggies.  Very disappointing.  And the service was almost non-existent.

Besides making good pizza and beer, it also serves at least 23 craft beers from around the country.  There is something for everyone here.  As for tap beers, you can choose from Lagers/Pilsners to ambers/browns/reds, sours, blondes/wheats, stouts/porters, IPAs, and extra strong specialty beers.

I walked in with a friend to try some unique beers.  I first had the Freak'NVanilla Hazelnut Coffee Brown (an American brown ale that is no longer brewed because the brewery has permanently closed and was bought out by Throne Brewing).  Perhaps that is why the beer tasted flat.  The second beer I had was a house beer, the Address Malt Witman, a Belgian witbier served in a 12-ounce tulip.  My friend had an Address Miguel, an American Porter and then a Lost Abbey Judgement Day Belgian Strong ale brewed in San Marcos, CA.  He liked them both.

I enjoyed the ambiance of the place, with framed t-shirts on the wall and a dark, quiet atmosphere.  We sat in the larger dining area and were the only people in that room for most of the visit.  It got more busy as we were ready to leave.  I can see this being a loud place among the Greek House residents who live nearby.

Not only was I pleasantly surprised, but I plan on making a trek back here sometime in the near future to try out their other items.

They have a nice menu here. Filled with pizza and Italian classics. For dessert they also have cheesecake on the menu (which sadly, was not available). Now that I am on that subject, I was a little disappointed that they did not have many items available (such as the bistro style meals) during my visit. Maybe someday they will update the menu and/or bring them back. 

Since I was eating by myself this time, I opted to get a small pizza with pepperoni, along with garlic cheese toast. 

The pizza here was fantastic! The people here place a premium on toppings, so it is a bit thicker than usual, though not Chicago style thick;  so if you like toppings on your pizza, this is the place for you! The sauce was very fresh tasting, and complemented my toppings well. A very tasty pizza. 

The garlic cheese bread was good, freshly made and served on french bread, and containing ample cheese. My only issue was that it did not taste like there was any garlic on it. 

That said, despite a few minor quibbles, I really enjoyed my time here and recommend it. Hopefully they fix their menu, and make sure that their garlic cheese bread contains garlic next time around.",6/15/2021 22:06,1

Since I used to have a client who lived nearby, I remember coming here often, and have fond memories of eating pizza and working on homework here when I was in college. 

In a way, this place reminds me a lot of growing up in New Jersey. Every neighborhood had a small local pizza joint that they frequented. In fact, where I grew up, there were about 4 within a mile from me, and they were all different from each other. 

Just like my neighborhood joints, the pizza here is not the best, but it's not the worst either. It is made quickly, with quality ingredients, and it comes out of the oven very hot and crispy. Can't say I have had anything else, because I do not need to.

I handed the person taking my order my card and she handed me back a slip that said $7.60. I said, what's up with this? She informed me 'as of the new year' they charge a whole dollar to use a debit/credit card. Of course this was after I placed my order.

They seated us within 5 minutes which we were surprised because the place was so busy. We were seated outside and it was amazing.

The scallops came with a Parmesan risotto mixed with corn and asparagus (I held the pancetta). It felt like the perfect light dish but still very filling. The scallops had a perfect seared top. The corn gave it a sweetness that paired well with the risotto. And the asparagus cut small enough to give a bit of texture to every bite. Was truly delicious. The Squid Ink was used to make the pasta which was super cool it gave it its black color. Pasta was al dente served in a slightly spicy red sauce with shrimp and calamari.

Let me start by saying I LOVE Chicago style deep dish pizza. Finding good deep dish outside of the Windy City is really hard. So when I saw Oregano's offered true Chicago style deep dish I was very excited. 

The first time I ordered a deep dish stuffed crust pizza, and I have probably never said this before (and can't believe I'm saying it now) it was too cheesy. Like eating a whole block of mozzarella cheesy. As much as I like cheese I want to also taste the sauce and the crust but I couldn't, just cheese. But, I thought I did order a stuffed crust deep dish maybe it was on me for not realizing how much cheese would be involved. So I made up my mind to try them again before passing judgement. 

Unfortunately the second time was almost a carbon copy of the first. I avoided the stuffed crust pizza this time and went for a regular deep dish, and added in some extra meat toppings too, but even after that it was still just cheese I was able to taste. And to top it off it was very expensive. They charge through the nose for every topping you add. 

I will say that the garlic cheese bread was very good. Here I took exception with the fact that the charge extra for marinara. (yeah really) 

For the cost I don't see the value. Clearly the people of Tucson must like Oregano's since they have 3 locations so maybe I am missing something but it likely isn't based off of their deep dish pizza. I may be back to try other items but sparingly given the cost.",4/30/2021 1:19,1

The garlic knots were burnt to the point where whoever cooking them should have thrown them in the trash. The chicken that went on the pizza was old sliced breaded chicken fingers, which is both confusing and kinda gross. 

When I started this review, a message popped up to remind me to be kind during COVID times...but you can't really use COVID as an excuse for bad food in this case. Nobody is in the lobby anymore, there's barely any customers outside, we didn't come at a rush time, so I'm a bit confused about why burnt garlic knots and burnt crusts are acceptable to serve? They have to look at the garlic knots before they're put into the bag...so the person saw them and thought ""ok, these are fine""...

We started out with a server (Contessa I believe?) who was so friendly and we immediately felt warm and welcomed. We let her know that we hadn't seen each other in years and were just going to be taking our time throughout the meal. She did inform us that our true server (Danni) was momentarily busy with just being sat an 8 top table but she treated us as if we were her own. After getting our drinks and putting in our appetizer, Danni came and introduced herself. This may not seem like any big deal, but what was amazing to me was the turnover the initial server had obviously given her - Danni acknowledged that we were celebrating something and hadn't seen each other in a while, making this meal already an Experience and not a pure transaction. Throughout the entire evening she checked on us but did not rush us, built a great rapport and continuously kept us laughing and taken care of. She timed out our courses so we were not rushed and never made us feel like an inconvenience. Her warm and inviting personality won us over completely! Towards the end of our meal, a member of our party put some cookie and ice cream in a to-go container. A bit later after cashing out, we went to depart for the evening and as we got to the door, Danni greeted us with a fresh cup if ice cream for her to take home. What a delight! Although we come to Oregano's because we enjoy the food, it's service like Danni's and Contessa's (I apologize if that is not the correct name because she was fantastic as well) that keep us coming back and make our experiences memorable. Thank you so much for a great evening!",9/20/2021 22:45,1

So of  course nothing had been reimbursed I called and spoke  CAM. He had no idea what I was talking about since the previous person ""Nicole"" Did not make any note about my complaint. I explained to  him about my order and he said  he would send it up to ""upper management"" and get it taken  care of. It is now March 12 and I still have not received my reimbursement.

Basic mozzarella cheese would have been nice for a blend cheese maybe a little Buffalo mozzarella to salt it up a bit. Sauce was mediocre lacked some flavor. Fresh bay leaf or basil and some more seasonings could bring it to life. Dough was nice and crunchy. Very good fluff.

I placed my order online and arrived maybe 2-3 minutes before the promised time. I was greeted outside at a podium by two friendly masked employees that were happy to let me use their very clean restrooms inside while I waited. My food needed about 5-10 more minutes to be ready.

By now you're probably wondering why I gave them 4/5 and not 5 stars- simple their food never lacks in size but sadly their pasta lacks in sauce and seasoning!

My first year here in Tucson, back in 2013, I ate at their food truck during the roller derby matches.  Since then I've eaten at the Speedway location and the River Road location, and have enjoyed both locations.  This one on Cortaro--not so great.  Maybe Marana has a way of ruining everything.  This location is about 5 minutes closer to my house than the River Road location and I thought I'd give it a try.  They have online ordering and I submitted my order at 4:48 PM.  I did not have any options for 5:00 PM pick up so I submitted for 5:30 PM.  At the River location, they usually have my food ready by the time I get there.  I arrived at 5:05 and thought that it would be ready since I'm used to speedy service.  I also considered getting some beer to go but they only have 10 taps and none of them were that exciting, which is disappointing considering the awesome selections at River and Speedway.  After waiting in line for 10 minutes to tell her I was there for a pick up, she went back to check and it wasn't.  She said it would be 7 minutes.  So I waited.  In the time that I waited several other people came in to order their food and she took phone orders telling them it would be ready in about 10 minutes.  People that came in and ordered their food after me got their food before me.  As I'm watching all the other orders go out I notice that there's a man in the back, just standing around talking and not wearing a mask in the food prep area.  Additionally one of the cooks has his mask around his chin, not covering his face.  My food was not ready 7 minutes later and it was not ready at 5:30.  When they finally do bring my food out, the fries are cold from sitting on the counter for a while and they're soggy from being tied up in a plastic bag.  I know the risk of getting covid is supposed to be low from food but it would have been great if the people in the back had on masks.  When I asked the girl who brought out my food if the men who aren't wearing mask prepared my food, she lied and said no, even though I saw the man with the mask on his chin out my sandwich on the order table.

(so she wasn't going to bother to tell us that?) we asked her if she could have someone move another heater over to us since we saw one not being used and she said yes and walked away. 5 minutes later we see the other table that complained having that heater rolled to them that we had just asked her for. INSANELY ridiculous, we didn't bother with dessert and went to frost across the street. i won't be back unless it's just for pickup. don't bother dining here if you want to be ignored, missing items from the food you order, and want to ask for things multiple times before someone finally remembers. it's a shame because the food is good.",3/29/2021 19:42,0

We arrived after the lunch rush for the day and the restaurant wasn't very busy but our server, Lexani I believe, was not very attentive.  She was also working the bar this day and was more interested in completing her busy work requirements in order to end her shift.  I had a clear view of the kitchen and could see the first part of our order sitting up at the pass-thru for almost 15 mins before she brought it to us.  The manager on duty walked by our food sitting up there multiple times, ignoring it.  At one point he was chatting with someone on his cell phone.
Eventually I finished my drink and wanted a refill.  The cup sat empty for over 10 mins before I asked a server that wasn't our server for a refill.  Our salad plates and my empty cup sat on our table for over 35 mins until our main course came to the table, via the manager this time because our server was still too busy for us.  The manager cleared our dirty plates, one of which had a dead fly on it that I killed, because they were flying all around restaurant (See pic)

They chop up the beef really fine which is awesome, because some places serve up the nasty chewy gristle that ruins the sandwich but not this place. Pizza was thin crust type but was very tasty and sweet tomato sauce made it nice.  The toppings were decent, and had the right amount of cheese (not piled on).  The habanero wings had really good flavor but were a bit too smokey for my taste.  This location was decent and spacious, the seats were metal chairs (cringy) but the food made up for it.  Only downside is that they have pepsi products to drink if you're a coke person. Will be back for sure.",10/16/2020 1:21,1

-- 2 bloody marys tasted zesty 'n spicy hot --  but had ZERO alcohol 
   for $15.00 !!  sad

-- calamari was really hot & delicious but only a meager portion - just a 
   handful with 2 sauces taking up volume on the plate     $14.00 !!  --- 
   just a handful !!
-- since the owner is from Maryland,  you'd think he'd have a genuinely 
   SUPERIOR tartar sauce & cocktail sauce w/ some horseradish !!

-- spinach/arugula salad was over the top expensive!   super sweet w/NO- 
   flavor dressing -- by far the most expensive item for some greens !!

-- meatball sub was loved by the person eating it - he said it was very filling 
-- his Caesar side salad had NO-flavor dressing       $16.00 !!

-- we asked for dry-rub extra crispy wings after viewing them in a photo,  but 
   got drippy-wet buffalo sauce -- boo hoo       $15.00 for a meager portion !!

-- BEST part was the coconut porter on draft
-- waitress was cute & friendly,  but didn't bring napkins,  forks,  or extra 
   plates to share wings, etc 
   waitress also left my real expensive salad sitting up there for quite some 
   time in the warm summer air
   we gave her a HUGE tip anyway assuming she was a student
   $82.00        for lunch w/o the tip !!
-- they deleted peel 'n eat shrimp along w/multiple other items - bummer !!

Our waitress was very monotone and seemed inconvenienced to greet us/take our drink order. I asked our waitress for light cheese sprinkled on top of our pizza like I saw in a previous customers helpful photo on Yelp. I don't like a lot of Daiya cheese on my pizza. The pizza arrived with a lot of cheese and barely any sauce. (The sauce that was on there was delicious.) Next time I'd just say no cheese to play it safe, and I hope that waitress is having a better day today.",11/30/2021 22:59,0

x3VG111BwTbwBHX5xJBr7A,JLmpKM9AsEATkkBgLCgQKg,WZUIlyefoUhuH_VkVCEyAw,1,1,1,0,"Not good. It was a struggle to order a family meal to go. Hostess was clueless, i was put on hold for about 15 min and next person was as equally clueless. Finally told me to call back in morning. 
Decided to go and order in person the next day. Hostess send us to bartender. He was busy but took our order for pick up the next afternoon. 
Went to pick up and clueless hostess sent me to bartender again, fiod not ready and told to wait.No offer of beverage or water while waiting, and she was also too busy to be bothered with takeout order. 

The food: lasagne was heated according to directions, but was lacking in flavor and kind of chewy. Salad was fresh romaine with cheese and crutons, but no salad dressing in bag or on salad. Bread was too dense for my diners. They also said it didn't have and garlic flavor. It was like garlic butter poured on top, but nothing on the actual slices.
Lastly and the worst was the tiramisu. Looked ok in container, but was a soupy mess. If there were lady fingers they disolved into the coffee flavored goo in the container.  Was there alcohol in it? Opinions were mixed, we did not want alcohol in it. 
We served this meal about 2 hours after pick up, so no excuse for awful dessert unless it was made long before and thawed out.
Nope. Won't  revisit. Typical bland american style chain restaurant. Half of the menu is bar drinks, so maybe that explains all the rave reviews. Side note, there was extra sauce included with no idea what we were to do with it. One was an awful, a garlic parmesan sauce that tasted like it was starting to go sour. 

There was just nothing good about anything.",07-09-2021 23:39,0

As an ""express"" location the only thing I can tell is different is that you order at the counter and their menu is slightly more limited than the other locations. The food is solid, like the other locations, however, the issue is with service. I've gone 3 times over the course of the last few months of it being open and the issues have not been resolved. All 3 were takeout orders, all 3 with issues. French fries instead of onion rings. Requested no cheese, got cheese on the burger. Missing a calzone completely. Honestly, though, the reason why I most likely won't return is the horrible wait which is always well over 40 minutes for a takeaway order. 
Anyways, I'd rather take a trip down to the original location or just go to native instead.",04-12-2020 03:12,0

My boyfriend and I ordered two pizzas. We timed our pick up with their estimated time but I'll admit it seemed a little cold since we placed our order. But putting the pizza in the stove for broil fixes that right up!!

The wings arrived warm, with a crunchy exterior but moist interior. The Asian garlic sauce,  Salt & Vinegar dry rub, and the Kickin Bourbon sauce were great.  However, the disappointing sauce was the Habanero Mango since it lacked flavor compared to BWW's version. For fun, we got the kids mac n cheese which is just Kraft and some tater tots. Both met expectations.  The funnelcake fries desert was ok.",11/21/2021 0:16,1
